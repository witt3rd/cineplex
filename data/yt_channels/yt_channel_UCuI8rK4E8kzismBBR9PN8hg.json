      "description": "Join my email list to learn about upcoming classes and openings in the Coaching Group:\nhttps://www.schoolofi.org\n\nI have been studying Conscious Personal Mastery most of my life. I share the Truth that has helped me - in hope that it also helps others. Discovering Neville Goddard in 2016, I knew I was hearing Truth - the Secrets of the Universe. I needed to know all that Neville knew - and I set out on a quest to learn as much as I can from him. \n\nI wasn't satisfied with the quality of the often robot-read books and lectures on other Youtube channels - so I decided to create my own channel and a library of lectures and books to share with the world.\n\nI read Neville's words for you as I read them to myself. When I hear beautiful truth in a sentence of a Neville book or lecture, I often pause to let that truth digest - or repeat the words again to allow them clear passage. It is my desire to transmit their meaning clearly - I thank you for watching!",
