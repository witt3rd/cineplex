I feel like this music should live on to the benefit of those of us who have been in the scene for decades and to allow the next generation an opportunity to experience the music that helped incubate the dance music culture. \n\nI'm NOT trying to profit on other people's work. This channel is not and will not be monetized. YouTube claims copyrights for holders and (as long as the artists have claimed their copyrights) pays the copyright holder(s). If your work is here and you'd rather it not be, just shoot me a message and I'll happily take it down. No need to report me to YouTube - I'm a very reasonable person and, again, this is all about keeping the culture alive! If your music is here it is because I'm a huge fan and I love your work!",
