      "description": "Dunkelwerk is the name of a German band which describes its sound as Endzeit Electro, referring to a genre which was originally established by bands like Wumpscut and Le\u00e6ther Strip and is nowadays produced by bands like The Retrosic, Suicide Commando or Hocico. Dunkelwerk consists of only one person and is a pure studio project, not doing any live performances or any other public events. The name of the band is an old German idiom which can be translated as \"dark work\" or \"dark factory\". The producer behind Dunkelwerk has decided to work under the pseudonym \"losttrooper\", being restrained to offer pictures of himself.",
