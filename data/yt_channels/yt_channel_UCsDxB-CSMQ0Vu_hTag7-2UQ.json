      "description": "Welcome to my channel, glad you stopped by! If you've watched my painting videos before, thank you! If you haven't yet, well, there's a bunch of content waiting for you right now.\n\nI'm a professional artist with 15 years' experience in the film, TV, game, and print industries - primarily as a concept artist and illustrator. I also happen to believe that it's the duty of experienced artists to pass on what they've learned, with no BS and for as low-cost as possible. It's for that reason that I'm a passionate teacher. I currently teach at CGMA, and have previously taught at Academy of Art University, Centennial College, and more. \n\nI've also been on YouTube since 2008. My videos range from painting fundamentals, to applied painting demos, to insights into how to grow (and work) as a creative person. \n\nFull length workshops are available at https://MarcoBucciArtStore.com\nTo support free educational content production, consider supporting via Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/marcobucci",
