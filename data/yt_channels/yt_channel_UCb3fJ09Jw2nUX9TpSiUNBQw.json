      "description": "Reviews of clothing, boots, and accessories for men, along with style advice and life philosophy. I've been working with my hands for my entire life as a mechanic, tow truck driver, and eventually a licensed electrician. Being a blue collar guy, I look for certain elements in a product: is it durable? Is it high-quality? Will it perform well over its service life? Whether boots, pants, jackets, or tools I believe it's best to buy once and cry once by getting the best you can afford. With so many options these days, choosing the best product can become a difficult decision, but that's where I come in. Helping you stay stylish, rugged, and handsome.\nI don't care where it's made as long as it's made well, and allows you to buy less and buy better.",
