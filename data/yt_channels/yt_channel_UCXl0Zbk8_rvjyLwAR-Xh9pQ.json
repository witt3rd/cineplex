Toronto 1979, PhD Yale 1984 and currently Assoc Prof at UNSW, with over 40 papers, one book, and a love of teaching.\n\nIf you would like to become a Patron of this Channel to support the videos I am making, please sign up at https://www.patreon.com/njwildberger?ty=h. Patrons will have access to a suite of pdf files which capture the video screens, making learning even easier.",
