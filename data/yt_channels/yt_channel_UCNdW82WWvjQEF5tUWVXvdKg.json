Since October 2021 I've started the extensive process of curating and then animating talks of Dr. Jordan Peterson and his guests. every animation has an average of 6-8 hours spent animating and 1-2 hours of rendering.\n\n I've spent over 700 hours curating lectures of Dr. Jordan Peterson and have found enough information that stands on its own outside of the lectures to fit into separate video clips. Dr. Jordan Peterson has given me explicit permission to upload clips and the email exchange between us can be found in my community tabs.\n\n\nIf you enjoy the Content I provide, please, Subscribe and like the videos you watch.",
