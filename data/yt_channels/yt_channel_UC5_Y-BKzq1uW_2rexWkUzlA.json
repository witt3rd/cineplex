The world we interact with and engage with is a culmination of millennia of curiosity, probing and discovery. The story of how we got here, the layers of seeking and exploration; that are too often displaced as a triviality of life, is a massive part of the human story.\n\nNew Mind is a celebration of that journey; the telling of slivers of that human story.
