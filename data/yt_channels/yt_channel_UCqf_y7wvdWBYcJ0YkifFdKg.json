It is something I genuinely enjoy, but it is clearly more then I could bear doing in evenings after work or on weekends. Now, I am not naive enough to believe that I just need to ask nicely and all my expenses are covered, but already a sign that, with a reasonable growth of the community, the channel might one day sustain itself would be a great help to ensure the future of MarbleScience.\n\nThank you so much for considering to support MarbleScience! Your subscription means a lot to me and if you want to help even more, you can find further information on my Patreon page. Thank you. I greatly appreciate it!\n\nWarm Regards,\nTobias\n",
