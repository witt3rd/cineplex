Our original mission was to rid the galaxy of low standards of entertainment. We've since discovered that the best way to do this is to arm our viewers with a unique perspective on entertainment media, culled from behind the scenes info and logical content analysis. We uncover hidden complexity in the blithely dismissed (Batman v Superman, Prometheus) and expose shallow value in the universally revered (Inception, Silent Hill).\n\nJoin us on our mission through the entertainment galaxy!
