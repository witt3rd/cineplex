      "description": "Vipassana Meditation - as taught by S.N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin\n\nIt is a simple, practical way to achieve real peace of mind and to lead a happy, useful life. Vipassana means \"to see things as they really are\". It is a logical process of mental purification through self-observation. From time to time, we all experience agitation, frustration and disharmony. Vipassana enables us to experience peace and harmony by purifying the mind of suffering. It leads to the highest spiritual goal of full liberation from all mental defilements.\n\nThese videos are bought to you by Vipassana Research Institute (VRI) a non-profit-making body with the principal aim of conducting scientific research into the Vipassana Meditation Technique. The financing for running VRI comes mainly from donations.
