And I try to dive deeper into those topics to provide context.\n\nTopics like electric vehicles, solar panels, and renewable energy that is meant to transition the world off of fossil fuels.  Smart home technology that can make our homes not only more convenient, but safer and more accessible.  Wearable technology that can track our health and save lives.
