The primary goal is to address the STEM based skills gap that prevent people from entering or advancing in the manufacturing industry. Some secondary goals are to discuss industry trends, engineering skills, and new technologies that are shaping the industry in new and exciting ways.\n\nThe way to get the most out of this channel is to go to the playlist and look for the topic of interest.
