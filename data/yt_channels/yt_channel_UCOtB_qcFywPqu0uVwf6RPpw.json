      "description": "Conviction. Righteousness. Ruthlessness.\n\nWar is the teacher, soldiers its students. Faith and Knowledge the the greatest weapons of war. Through stories, podcasts, books and film the hope is to reshape the narratives to strengthen our resolve, awaken the truth that we feel but can't always explain, to expand our vision beyond the limits of the Matrix and bring us closer to God. In the end, God wins. \n\n\nAbout the Film.\nAfghanistan is known as the graveyard of empires. The ruins of past occupiers litter the landscape. For a small group of Canadians, history was only a roadmap of lessons to be learned, not fate to be trapped by. Over the course of 10-days they became warriors and in the process changed a nation. When you live by conviction, fighting is everything.\n\nThe documentary film featuring Emmy Award winning footage will be available right here on our own website and through our online affiliates starting 1 October 2018.\n\nbardsofwarfilm.com",
