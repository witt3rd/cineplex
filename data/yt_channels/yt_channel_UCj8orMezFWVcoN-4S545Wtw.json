Eventually my interest and research in psychology, philosophy and their effect on the world and, in this case, specifically the area of entertainment, led me to further research. \n \nMore recently, I have been drawn to the important topics of mental health and autism. Never has there been a more important time for us to be informed, raise awareness and support one another throughout the various challenges we are faced with in life.",
