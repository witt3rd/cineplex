We gather great minds in science and the arts to produce live and digital content that allows a broad general audience to engage with scientific discoveries. Through discussions, debates, original films, lectures, and intimate salons, the World Science Festival takes science out of the laboratory and out into world. \n\nThe World Science Festival is a production of the World Science Foundation, a 501c3 non-profit headquartered in New York City.  Our mission is to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by its wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.",
