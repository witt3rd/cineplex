I specialize in the techniques used by professional card cheats and also studied neurobiology in college. As a result, I like to explore the interaction between sleight-of-hand and sleight-of-mind as it appears in magic. In simpler terms, I make videos about how magicians (and card cheats, hustlers, fraudulent psychics, etc.) are able to trick your brain into tricking you! :)\n\nMilestones:\n1,000 Subscribers: October 17th, 2020\n5,000 Subscribers: January 2nd, 2021\n10,000 Subscribers: January 20th, 2021\n25,000 Subscribers: February 14th, 2021\n50,000 Subscribers: May 27th, 2021\n75,000 Subscribers: July 7th, 2021\n100,000 Subscribers: November 20th, 2021\n",
