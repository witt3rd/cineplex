      "description": "Google Tech Talks is a grass-roots program at Google for sharing information of interest to the technical community.  At its best, it's part of an ongoing discussion about our world featuring top experts in diverse fields.  Presentations range from the broadest of perspective overviews to the most technical of deep dives, on topics well-established to wildly speculative.\n\nDisclaimer:  Google TechTalks are designed to disseminate a wide spectrum of views on topics including Current Affairs, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Business, Humanities, Law, Entertainment, and the Arts.  The views or opinions expressed by the guest speakers are solely their own and do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of Google, Inc.\n\nCredits:  The original title animation and theme were created by Nick Thomas.  The mid-2016 title animation was designed by Matt McDonald.  The mid-2016 theme music was composed and created by Mark Lentczner (https://soundcloud.com/mtnviewmark).",
