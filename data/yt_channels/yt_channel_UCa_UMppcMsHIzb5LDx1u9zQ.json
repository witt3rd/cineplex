      "description": "TheFatRat is the EDM moniker of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany's Christian B\u00fcttner, whose music ranges from euphoric progressive house to orchestral trap, melodic glitch-hop and K-Pop with a heavy influence of video game music. He is enormously popular on YouTube, particularly with the gaming community, currently boasting one of the largest followings and most engaging fan-bases on the web for an artist in his genre. TheFatRat\u2019s forward-thinking approach to lift copyright restrictions\u00a0on his music has led him having been\u00a0featured in 25 million videos - collectively accounting for 30 billion unique views on the platform. Over the years he has become one of the most top-charting acts in dance music, having had multiple singles remain in the iTunes top100 for over 3 years straight. He has had his music synched-to-screen for popular video games like the top-grossing DOTA 2 and Rocket League and has planted himself as the go-to artist for ESports brands like ESL and Dreamhack.",
