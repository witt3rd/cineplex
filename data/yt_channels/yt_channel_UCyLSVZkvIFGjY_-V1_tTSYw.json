      "description": "I want to share with you the latest news about the genuine diamonds that are being found in southwest Arkansas and teach you what I know.  I am literally THE GUY who wrote the book on diamonds in Arkansas.  I have also had numerous, magazine articles published on the subject.  When my article, \"Hunting For Big Diamonds In Arkansas,\" was published in Gold Prospector Magazine's gem issue, they put a photo of me on the front cover.  I find genuine diamonds at Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds State Park. I have found 176 so far.  This park has white (clear), brown, and yellow diamonds.  My two largest ones weigh over two carats each. The yellow one weighs 2.04 carats and is still in its uncut, natural form.  The brown weighed 2.13 carats when I found it, but I had it cut to a gorgeous, 1.21-carat marquise.  I also host a professionally produced DVD called, \"How To Find Genuine Diamonds in Arkansas.\"  You can download the eDVD from our website for immediate viewing.  www.DiamondsInAR.com",
