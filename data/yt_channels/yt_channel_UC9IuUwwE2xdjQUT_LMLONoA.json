      "description": "Julia is a high-performance, dynamic programming language for modern technical computing. It solves the two language problem by being simultaneously as fast as C and as easy as Python. The built-in package manager provides access to over 6,000 Julia packages created by the Julia community, in addition to foreign function interfaces for tens of thousands of C, Fortran, Python, and R libraries.\n\nThe Julia package ecosystem includes best in class packages in a number of ecosystems: Image Processing, Machine Learning, Data Science, Optimization, Parallel computing, Cloud computing, Automatic Differentiation, Graph Processing, Probabilistic Programming, Finite Elements, Computational Biology, Ecology, Climate science, Astrophysics, Quantum Computing, and much more.\n",
