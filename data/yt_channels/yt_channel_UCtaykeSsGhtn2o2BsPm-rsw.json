Over the years, I\u2019ve pursued a wide range of passions \u2014 music, photography, video, web development, graphic design and now woodworking. While that might seem like a crazy path, I\u2019ve come to realize they\u2019re more similar than you think. They\u2019re all creative pursuits, and when you\u2019re done, you\u2019ve made something that wasn\u2019t there before. That\u2019s kind of amazing, and it\u2019s something I think everyone should have the opportunity to experience.",
