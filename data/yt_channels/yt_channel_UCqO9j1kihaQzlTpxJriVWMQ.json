They are all based on real models in physics and maths, typically describing the evolution in time of some system: a particle or a wave in a closed domain, a growing interface, a population of animals. \nThanks to all those sending me suggestions for other simulations. I will try to implement some of them. I am also making available the code used to create some of these videos, once I have tested it in a number of cases, so you have the possibility of downloading the code and modifying it yourself.\n\n\n",
