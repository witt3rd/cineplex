      "description": "The Reality Revolution podcast is hosted by Brian Scott, a writer, entrepreneur, epiphany addict, inner space astronaut, life coach, transformation engineer, futurist, hypnotist, neurolinguistic programmer, meditation instructor, motivational speaker, researcher, intuition teacher, luck instructor and founder of the Advanced Success Institute. The Reality Revolution is born out of a fanatical vision quest to understand a near-death experience which was the culmination of a profound spiritual awakening in which Brian explores whether he has shifted into a parallel reality. The mission of the Reality Revolution podcast is to explore the new movement to hack reality exploring experiential quantum physics, reality transurfing, quantum jumping, meditation, hypnosis, qi-gong, sensory deprivation, virtual reality, mind tech, ayahuasca, psychedelics, channeling,  manifestation, mindfulness, neurolinguistic programming, epigenetics, EFT, energy psychology, yoga, luck coaching, and so much more.",
