      "description": "Actualized.org is a catalog of over 400 hours of advanced videos about self-help, psychology, emotional mastery, philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, sociology, spirituality, psychedelics, nonduality, mysticism, consciousness, love, and more. Our focus is a deep understanding of the nature of reality, life, and the inner workings of the human mind. We tackle deep questions such as: What is reality? What is consciousness? What is God? What is the point of life? What is happiness? How do I live the good life? How do I become successful? How do I master my emotions? How to I avoid suffering? etc.\n\nActualized.org is not just armchair philosophy. This understanding is practical and applicable to improving the quality of everyday life. Everything we talk about has real-world consequences.\n\nActualized.org is a non-ideological teaching grounded in direct experience and contemplation. All claims made on this channel are testable and should not be taken on faith or turned into an ideology.",
