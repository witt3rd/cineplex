      "description": "Hey guys, I'm Mike, I'm 30, I'm from the UK, I'm a software engineer and I'm also a game dev! Now that the introductions are out of the way... What about why I'm here?\n\nWell, I started my game dev journey about 7 years ago now. I picked the Unity game engine to start with because I'd heard good things about it and I'd seen the Unity logo all over games that I enjoyed playing... Well that enthusiasm didn't last long... I quickly became overwhelmed with all the features Unity has at it's disposal and closed the software down, thinking I'll never be a game developer.\n\nI decided I wasn't going to give up so easily and decided to put more effort into learning and 6 months later I was able to release my first mobile game!\n\nSo what I want to do is compile my 7 years experience with Unity and give you guys the tutorials that I wish I had access to when I first started learning game development! So join me and learn what the Unity engine has to offer and BECOME A GAME DEVELOPER!!",
