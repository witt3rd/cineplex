      "description": "My name is Adam Chandler and this channel is all about the ins and outs of Game Development. I create game-dev tutorials using Unity and Unreal with a programming emphasis, but not exclusive to programming! I also enjoy talking about Sound Design and Aesthetic as well, so be on the lookout for those videos. We'll explore a good mix of basic, intermediate and advanced concepts in these videos, though I always try to build even the advanced concepts from the basics.\n\nThe goal of this channel is to give an in depth breakdown of concepts while we look at practical examples. I believe it's much better for videos to explain things clearly as we go, rather than just be a quick list of buttons to click. This means that the videos may be a bit longer... but that's because they're packed with content!\n\nYou can find my longer tutorial topic series in the Playlists Tab, so feel free to start browsing!",
