Sometimes we do it through boosting recycling, other time by adopting zero waste lifestyles, from time to time we organize educational workshops. Whatever works.\n\nWe see people in the local community as the key element to fix this mess, we count on people to bring the necessary change. Small steps, multiplied by millions. That's how we can win our battle. We don't believe in techno-utopian, fix-it-all, dream technology.\n\nWe are very inspired by the idea of Precious Plastic. It is a combination of people, machines, platforms and knowledge to create an alternative global recycling system.  Thanks to Plastikowa Rewolucja in Warsaw where they show us how to do it, we decided to spread this further - in Edinburgh!\n",
