      "description": "This channel is a way of sharing incredibly rare Prog/Psych/Folk/Glam music (mainly from the 1960s -70`s) with youtubers, it will feature some of the rarest ever vinyl releases, many complete Albums with photos of their artwork and obscure band photos, plus sharing some unreleased recordings that I have access to. As a collector some I own, some I have now sold, some I am unlikely to own (i.e Bread & Beer band). When it comes to values/prices they will usually be for Mint/Near Mint original 1st Issue pressings which are now very rare and the price quoted is the price they have sold for in that condition. Why not subscribe as I will be uploading new videos regularly!!! I hope you enjoy the Ride!!",
