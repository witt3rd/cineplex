      "description": "The Engineering Mindset was started in 2015 by its founder, Paul Evans. The mission was to help students, engineers and like-minded people learn technical engineering topics through short, simplified tutorials. Our goal is to be the number one resource and online learning tool for all aspects of engineering. We minimise technical jargon while using detailed illustrations and animations to help convey the essentials of each subject with on-demand, internet based, education.\n\nOur motto is simple: Simplify. Teach. Inspire.\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0fGHsCEzGig-rSzkfCjMw/join\nBuy Paul a coffee here: https://www.paypal.me/TheEngineerinMindset\nBecome a patreon supporter: https://www.patreon.com/theengineeringmindset\n\nSome links displayed within the content are affiliate links and we may receive commission.",
