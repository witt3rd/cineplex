      "description": "Welcome to my channel! Here you find my: Sense of Scale documentary. Short films. Commercials. \nScience Fiction. Miniature effects. Fun behind the scenes!\n\nThis channel is mainly for my SENSE OF SCALE documentary about film industry model makers. \nThe doc focuses on the people and their work. It is self financed, and not from the major studios. \nI wanted to let the model makers tell their own model shop stories from their perspective. Since\nthe doc is more than 12 hours long, I have broken it up into short segments. Most of the interviews\nwere recorded from 2010-2012. \n\nA new segment will be posted every week! Stay tuned.
