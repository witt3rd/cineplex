I'll put things in my hydraulic press, vacuum chamber and perform countless other experiments just to watch cool phenomenon. I experiment on the world and objects around me. You'll be so amazed that you'll forget you are even learning anything! Please enjoy as I continually answer the \"what would happen if...\" questions you have. Feel free to comment with any scientific questions you have about anything. I have made my career as a PhD in Chemical Engineer and now I want to share how awesome science and experimentation can be! \n\nVisit my Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheActionLabOfficial",
