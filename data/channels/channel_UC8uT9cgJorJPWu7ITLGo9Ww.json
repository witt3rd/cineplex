However, once or twice a year I'll create something totally \"out there.\"  My main goal at this point is to make educational content about retro technology that is interesting and engaging.  Some people will be re-living their childhood, while others will be experiencing the technology for the first time. \n\nYou can help support this channel and content by donating $1 per month on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/8BitGuy1",
