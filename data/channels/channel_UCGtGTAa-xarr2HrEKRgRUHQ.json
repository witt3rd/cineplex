      "description": "Hi, I'm Peter Draws, and I enjoy drawing. My real name is Peter Deligdisch. Here is where I do primarily timelapse drawing videos. I draw, and then I speed up the footage using Adobe Premiere Pro and record a little commentary to put over it.\n\nMy favorite pens are probably Rotring Isographs, and I like Crescent Rendr and Moleskine Sketchbooks, or Bristol paper for loose-leaf. I also enjoy a wide variety of fountain pens, glass dip pens, etc. I just like drawing lines! \n\nI also attempt other types of art from time to time as well, just to keep things fresh. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks for stopping by!\n",
