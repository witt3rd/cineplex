      "description": "Hi there, Neil here!  Here at Real Terrain Hobbies our goal is to inspire and guide the way for you to turn your passion for realistic terrain into a tangible work of art. \n\nYou may think: But Neil, I'm no artist!  \n\nWell, my purpose is to prove to you that yes you are and it's a lot easier than you think, whether you're just beginning or an experienced modeler and want to learn the skills in how to take your models to that next level of realism!  \n\nYou may be overwhelmed on how to get started, suffering from analysis paralysis or just lack the discipline to see a project through.  Well, throw all of that out the window, get some simple supplies laid out for you in my easy to follow tutorials, and *JUST START USING* those hands through SIMPLE and EASY steps that will create something you never would have expected! \n\nIf you are interested in contacting me for any promotional or collaboration ideas, you can get a hold of me via the email below:",
