      "description": "Hey y'all, Dixie here! This channel began with my journey of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) from Georgia to Maine. Since then I've documented the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and The Camino de Santiago (French Way).  Most of my backpacking adventures involve long distance thru-hiking, but in between hikes I post informational videos that include the most basic backpacking info, my mistakes, gear reviews, and thru-hiking tips. I hope documenting my backpacking journeys and sharing everything I know gives you the push you need to get out there!\n\nNew videos are uploaded every Wednesday! Happy Trails :)",
