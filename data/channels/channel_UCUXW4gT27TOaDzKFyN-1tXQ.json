      "description": "Well what is up, my name is James and this is my channel Major Hardware. By day I'm a Mechanical Engineer, by night I'm a PC/Tech enthusiast. I love checking out new or interesting products doing my best to make them look as good as possible on camera. I also love thinking outside the box, trying to come up with new or interesting ideas on how to test hardware. Quite literally if you can dream it, you can design and build it and that is what i intend to do.\n\n\nHave a product you think I should look at or want to sponsor a video?
