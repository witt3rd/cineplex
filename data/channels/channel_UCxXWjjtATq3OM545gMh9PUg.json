      "description": "The Essence of Non-Duality\n\nIn clips taken from conversations at meetings or retreats, Rupert discuss all aspects of the non-dual understanding, from the initial investigation into our essential nature of pure Awareness, to the deeper exploration of consciousness and the separate 'me-feeling' in the body, to the realignment of the mind, body and world with this new understanding.\n\nThis is a contemporary, experiential approach to understanding the nature of reality and the self, involving silent meditation, guided meditation and conversation. It requires no affiliation to any religious or spiritual tradition, only an interest in the nature of experience, and the longing for love, peace and happiness.\n\nRupert studied the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and the tantric tradition of Kashmir Shaivism through Dr. Francis Roles, Shantananda Saraswati, P.D.Ouspensky, Krishnamurti, Rumi, Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta, Robert Adams, Francis Lucille, Atmanada Krishnamenon and Jean Klein.\n\n",
