      "description": "PizzaFLIX is a passion project created by two film industry professionals with 50 years combined experience. We control one of the largest, privately-held broadcast-quality film & TV libraries of its kind. These films are the foundation for our channel, an educational platform for the preservation and discovery of the Golden Age of Hollywood and Television. \n\nMuch care goes into preparing our films for the optimum YouTube streaming experience. Each title requires up to 12 hours to digitally-remaster before being encoded for upload. All titles are presented with 100% worldwide commercial audio & video streaming rights.\n\nWhile we work diligently to continue our schedule of 10 or more new monthly titles, our new focus is PizzaFLIX ORIGINALS. Early 2019 saw the premiere of DISSECTUS. We have several more shows now in pre-creation: SLICE (biography), THEY CALLED THEM POVERTY ROW, PIONEERS OF ANIMATION, and FROM EDISON TO SELZNICK.\n\nThanks for watching PizzaFLIX. May the Sauce be with you!",
