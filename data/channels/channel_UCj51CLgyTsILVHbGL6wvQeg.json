      "description": "This channel is all about my own tutorials on making games, using artificial intelligence and implementing machine learning algorithms.\n\nBesides demos of my own games, here you'll find helpful tutorials that show you how to create AI bots that can learn to play a variety of games.\n\nFor example, you can learn how to use genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks to perfectly play Flappy Bird game. Or how to make your own Quick Draw game by performing image classification based on convolutional neural networks.\n\nThe games are written in Javascript using Phaser framework and TensorFlow for machine learning.\n\nAll tutorials include free source code. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, make sure to subscribe and click the notification bell so you never miss a new video!\n\nTo learn more, visit my official website and read articles here:\nhttps://www.askforgametask.com",
