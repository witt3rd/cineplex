We started this channel back in February 2021. My brother generally prefers to stay behind the scenes but he does randomly pop up sometimes. He's our cameraman and video editor. We plan the videos together, but I do the scriptwriting and mainly host the channel.\n\nThanks for stopping by, and we hope you enjoy!\n",
