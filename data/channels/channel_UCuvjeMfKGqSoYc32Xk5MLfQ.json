      "description": "Hi, My name is Dennis, and I am from Hooked on Wood.\nAs a hobbyist woodworker, I started my youtube channel in 2019. I am interested in finding ways to improve my workshop, and as you watch my shop improvement playlist, you will discover that I try to search for new approaches to common problems. Sometimes, they are better, and sometimes they do not.  I try to inspire fellow woodworkers to look at different angles when creating a pleasant woodworking environment. \n\nChina Tools series\nI get a lot of excellent praise for my China tools series. Here I give In-depth reviews of woodworking products from China. Meanwhile, I tested a  lot of interesting products. On my website: www.hookedonwood.online you can find a ranking among these products. \nIt can save you some money.\n\nThank you for watching my channel. I hope you will subscribe and join the club. \n",
