I'm also an anime \"fan\", in the sense that certain anime really appeals to me.\nI'm currently working on some album reviews which you can expect to see soon. Other things you can find on the channel are clips of Jordan Peterson, usually from his Q/A sessions (which I have gotten permission to use). I hope to grow the channel with more of my own original content. With that in mind, I hope you'll stay (or at least enjoy your stay)! Do subscribe and all that :) Peace",
