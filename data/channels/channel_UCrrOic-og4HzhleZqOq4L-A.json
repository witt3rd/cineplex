But how can we get tell the truth from the fiction, and separate the fact from the rumor? Since 2008, Stuff They Don't Want You To Know has delved into the murky world of everything from cults to lost cosmonauts and allegations of the paranormal, applying critical thinking to the world's most prevalent conspiracy theories and, more often than not, discovering the disturbing grains of truth hidden in the heart of paranoia.
