      "description": "Founded by Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in 1988, Sub Pop Records is a medium-sized independent record label based in Seattle, WA. With early releases by Nirvana, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and TAD, the label is often associated with something called \"the grunge movement.\" Exploitation of this association has frequently proven financially fruitful. Later years saw record album releases from such moderately-to-somewhat-well-known artists as: Sebadoh, Sunny Day Real Estate, The Murder City Devils, Hot Hot Heat, The Shins, Iron and Wine, The Postal Service, Band of Horses, David Cross, Flight of the Conchords, Fleet Foxes, Beach House, Shabazz Palaces, and Father John Misty, among many other very talented and deserving artists whose managers will be contacting us shortly about inclusion in the preceding list.",
