      "description": "Welcome everyone to the definitive unemulated retro games channel ZEUSDAZ, I'm known as Zeus and I bring you a celebration of classic 8,16 & 32-bit games along with arcade games that many of us grew up with, with the added attraction that the games on this site are completely unemulated (unless stated), using all the original hardware the games were intended for.\n\nWith arond \"2000\" game videos uploaded (now including commentary \"Let's Play\" & \"Shit Game Time\" videos), I'm sure you will find many of your favourites on here, just click the little magnify glass and type a retro game name in to the search bar.\n\nAll clips in this video are of me playing, all uploads will have full descriptions, if I use cheats I will state that fact in the descriptions, this channel is all about showing as much of the game as possible which usually means using cheats, this channel is not about skill or performance so please don't have a go at me about any low skills.\n\nPlease spread this channel around  :-D",
