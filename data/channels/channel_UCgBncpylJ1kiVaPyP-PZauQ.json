I prefer illustrations, analogies, and cartoons, rather than formulas (although we don't shy away from the math when needed).\n\nThe topics I have are machine learning, mathematics (probability and statistics), but I'm open to many others. If you have any topics you'd like to suggest, feel free to add them in the comments or drop me a line!\n\nFor more information, check out http://serrano.academy.\n\nAnd also check out my book!
