I have been making documentary films and working on film crews\u2013now video crews of course\u2013since I was 21 years old. I am now 77 (December, 2018). I love real people and while I enjoy filming and doing interviews with famous folks, is the ordinary people and their wonderful extraordinary lives and stories that most fascinate me. I made this YouTube channel to share my work with others\u2013thinking of 3 generations. Mine. Those people now in their forties and fifties. And millennials.  I have very supportive of my subscribers and communicate with them as often as I can. My hope is to continue to grow my channel and someday make my living from my YouTube clips and the advertising YouTube allows. Thank you.\nwww.whoisdavidhoffman.com",
