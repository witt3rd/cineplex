      "description": "The Smugglers Room is a channel dedicated to building something out of nothing.  We use a large variety of materials and methods to create totally geeked out projects.  We include; 3D printing, electronics, woodworking, CNC carving, and more!  \n\nWe want our geek-a-fide projects to expose you to as many different approaches to building as we can.  We'll take you from concept to finished product and hopefully pass on a few tips along the way.\n\nThese videos are our way of providing a little entertainment as well as sharing techniques we have learned over the years from so many great people and projects.  We want to share our wild ideas with you, and hopefully inspire you to get out there and build something!",
