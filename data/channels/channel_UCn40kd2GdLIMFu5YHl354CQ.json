      "description": "I work alone in my home creating these films. There is no '\"Reader\", \"Presenter\" or \"Narrator\" as such - only me.\n\nMy aim is to disseminate scripture; make people think a little more about scripture, and further a far-deeper understanding of Biblical texts. Primarily, I want to reach existing people of Faith and help them become even greater ambassadors of God. \nI seek to bolster, embolden & edify the existing Faith of people of God. I also seek to start pockets of revival as a result.\n\nIn my personal life, I seek anointing of the Holy Spirit that I may anoint others to anoint others. Exponential evangelism.\nI pray a LOT.\nMuch of what I do seems in response to God's Holy Spirit.  All for the Glory of God and the furtherance of His holy kingdom.\n\nSUPPORT: No Greater Love & The Commands of Jesus at:\n   https://patreon.com/No_Greater_Love\n   https://paypal.me/NoGreaterLoveYouTube\n\nFor a free copy of Commands of Jesus PDF, visit:  https://mailchi.mp/d0847ab0f0a0/commands_of_jesus_pdf_free\n",
