You will learn how to level up your mindset, develop leadership skills in business and in your personal life, and learn how to live to your full potential. \n\nI drop weekly dose of inspiration every Tuesday and Thursday. \n-On Tuesdays, I have a long-format interview, Impact Theory, with elite entrepreneurs, athletes, and more.\n-On alternating Thursdays, I release Health Theory, where I interview the top health experts in their respective field and share those findings with you or Conversations with Tom where I and a different guest each month, discuss various topics from ego, failure, deep values and liberation, beauty and ambition, prison, drugs, and so much more. No topic is off-limits.\n\nSubscribe to this channel if you want to keep up to date with our content! \n\nFollow me on Instagram at www.instagram.com/tombilyeu",
