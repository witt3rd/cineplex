      "description": "Armageddon Dildos is a German electro-industrial-duo originally consisting of Uwe Kanka and Dirk Krause. The act was formed in 1988 in Kassel Germany, and the name comes from the slang term for intercontinental ballistic missiles. They perform songs in both German and English.\nThe Armageddon Dildos have been popular within their native Germany. Outside of Germany they have a cult following among industrial music lovers. In the United States their music has had some airtime on experimental music radio stations. They have been compared to bands like Rammstein, Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, and Coil.",
