Each of these innovations takes billions or even trillions of person-hours to develop and another trillion hours to debug.  However understanding the in-depth details of these complex systems requires thousands of hours of research, curriculum building, and content streamlining.  Our objective is to make engaging content that answers each and every facet of these complex systems.  Currently, we are making and evolving our video content to be as engaging as possible.    \n\nWant to support in-depth engineering and technology education?
