Hi, I'm an average guy and artist that likes like nature film and experimental films, spirituality, mysticism, pop culture, art and music - so my channel will have videos I make that reflect that. What you won't fine is loud screeching videos of ME, mugging for the camera and asking you to subscribe! Vanity and celebrity are the bane of america! Long live the person who doesn't need desperate attention.",
