      "description": "Bruderschaft is an electronic music collective led by New York City-based DJ Rexx Arkana. Conceived as a charity project focused on cancer research and treatment in the wake of Arkana's father's death from the disease, Bruderschaft brought together a large number of artists from the underground electronic music scene for the production of the band's first single, \"Forever\": the collaboration of Arkana, Ronan Harris, Sebastian Komor, Joakim Montelius and Stephan Groth.\nAfter the death of his father in 1999, Rexx Arkana shared with Ronan Harris and Joakim Montelius the lyrics he wrote for \"Forever\" and they were willing to help turn it into a proper song. In 2001, Arkana discussed the project with Sebastian Komor, who produced the basic track that later became \"Forever\" using loops that Montelius had made. In 2002, Harris was still willing to perform the lead vocals on the song and Stephan Groth was willing to perform backing vocals after hearing a rough version of the song.",
