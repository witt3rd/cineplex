These videos are my own perspectives and I invite you to discuss ideas or ask questions in the comment sections.\n\nExamples of the authors I study include Harold Percival, Carl Jung, Lahiri Mahasaya, Alice Bailey, Helena Roerich, Helena Blavatsky, Parmahansa Yogananda, Walter Russell, Joseph Smith, Jordan Peterson, Paul Selig, and all World Scriptures.\n\nI practice Raja Yoga meditation as taught in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.\n\nIf you wish to contribute to this community, here is my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=29200381 or you may PayPal me at powerful_thought_daily@yahoo.com.",
