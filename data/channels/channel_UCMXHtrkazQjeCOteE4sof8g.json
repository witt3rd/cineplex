      "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a programmer from my early 14 years. This is my hobby and I used to program everything from games/websites/apps/robots...\n\nI always work with music. Music with work is something I called \"meditation\". If you do what you love with nice music flow, it is blessed mood for me. So I started uploading music mixes on YouTube because I wanted to have this music always everywhere with me and I did not realize, that it was public to world.\n\nBut later on.. My videos started to have thousands / rather say ten thousands of views and people really like it. I did not know why they love my music so much and I was not planning anything. People start begging me to upload more and more content so I started uploading more music for work, reading, relax, traveling, study, programming and so on for people who like this style.\n\nNow I am creator one of the channels which serve people music for work.\n\nThanks for your support my friend :)",
