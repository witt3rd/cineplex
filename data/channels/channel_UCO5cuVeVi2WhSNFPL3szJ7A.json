      "description": "Welcome to the Flavor Lab!\n\n\nThe great experiment begins :)\n\nMy aim is this channel will be to find out how to develop cool and unique food things together with feedback from you. Although there are a million recipe videos out there, I really hope to find ways to experiment with unique ingredients, techniques and develop cool stuff through trial and error.\n\nI really want to create an environment where it is not frowned up on to make mistakes and to learn together. I derive so much pleasure and relaxation from cooking and experimenting, and I would like to share that, as well as keeping a record for myself. I feel like the environment of Youtube cooking channels tend to have a condescending tone (not all of them), and I hope to go against some of that with this blog/channel. I want to emphasize that I am not a professional cook, and there should be no gap between you and me.",
