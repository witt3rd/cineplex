I'm James Murphy and I make videos about programming and mathematics, mostly including Python and C++.\n\nMy goal is to help as many people as possible better their own skills by seeing coding and mathematics through my eyes. I'm a Carnegie Mellon and UT Austin trained mathematics Ph.D., I've worked in quantitative finance in Chicago and New York, and I'm taking all my knowledge and passing it on to viewers like you all around the world! In addition to making YouTube videos, mCoding offers consulting, contracting, code reviews, and training.\n\nWant to financially support my YouTube video production through a one-time or monthly donation? Great! I accept donations through the Patreon (monthly) and PayPal (one-time or monthly), see links below. Note: through Patreon I receive about 88% of what you donate, compared to 97% for PayPal.
