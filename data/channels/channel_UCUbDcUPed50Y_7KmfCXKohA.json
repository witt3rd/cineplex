      "description": "Former toy designer, current YouTube maker and general robotics, electrical and mechanical engineer, I\u2019m a fan of doing it yourself and innovation by trial and error. My channel is where I share some of my useful and not-so-useful inventions, designs and maker advice. Iron Man is my go-to cosplay, and 3D printing can solve most issues - broken bolts, missing parts, world hunger, you name it.\n\nMy recent projects include building various Star Wars droids including BB-8, a GONK Power Droid and R2-D2 R6, as well as various Marvel projects like my Iron Man and Hulkbuster projects. More serious robotics series include Ultron the \"Real Robot\" and my bipedal humanoid Robot X.\n\nFor business enquiries only, email below, otherwise check out my Facebook page, GitHub or Patreon.",
