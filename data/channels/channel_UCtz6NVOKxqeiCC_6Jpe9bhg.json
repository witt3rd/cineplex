      "description": "I quit my TV news career in 2019 after 12 years as a reporter. I have worked in Georgia, Tennessee, Florida and most recently Seattle where I was the Environmental Reporter for KING TV. I started my career as a booking producer for FOX & Friends on FOX News Channel. I decided producing wasn't for me and thought I wanted to be a psychologist, so I decided to go back to grad school. I obtained a Master of Divinity degree with a specialization in counseling from Boston University after which I planned to get a PhD in psychology. However, my preaching professor got me thinking about returning to news as a reporter. He told our class that we are all storytellers, and as such have the choice to use stories to move our communities forward or backward. I am the recipient of two Emmy awards as well as the Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi award for Excellence in Journalism. I am married to a USMC veteran and a mom to a little girl, a pit bull and two horses.",
