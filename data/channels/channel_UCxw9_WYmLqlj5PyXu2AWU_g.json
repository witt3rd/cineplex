      "description": "My name is Zak Jost and I'm currently working as a Research Scientist at Amazon Web Services in the Seattle area.  The point of this channel is to help people like you level up their Machine Learning skills.  \n\nThe current focus of this channel will be on Video lectures and Hands-on Screencasts.   For lecture material, the focus is on stripping away unnecessary formality and shining a light on the key points to build your intuition.  However, I am a firm believer that we learn best by doing, so the screencasts will compliment the lectures by walking you through building things from scratch.  \n\nOutside of YouTube, I also provide long-form blogs as a textual compliment.
