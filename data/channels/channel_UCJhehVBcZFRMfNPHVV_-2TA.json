      "description": "The School of Information is both UC Berkeley's newest and its smallest school. Located in the center of campus, the I School is a graduate education and research community that crosses the boundaries of law, economics, sociology, business, library science, engineering, design, publishing, linguistics, computer science, and information science.\r\n\r\nIn UC Berkeley's historic South Hall, roughly 100 graduate students and 13 faculty members form a small, multi-disciplinary collective of scholars and practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe I School offers a professional master's degree and an academic doctoral degree. Our master's program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.",
