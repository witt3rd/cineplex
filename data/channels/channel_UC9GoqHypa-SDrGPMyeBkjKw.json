      "description": "Hypnosis | Hypnotherapy | Sleep Meditation | Guided Meditation\n\nHi, my name is Michael and welcome to my channel, where I hope you can stop by to relax, listen in, and see for yourself the power of positive hypnosis.\n\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of often deeply felt relaxation and focused attention, where positive suggestions can be more easily accepted by our subconscious minds. Imagine a fantastic and tranquil state of daydreaming, and that is very close to hypnosis!  \n\nHypnosis can bring us improved self control, clearer and empowered behavioural choices, and allow us to listen to our best inner resources. Many people experience a deep sense of calmness and serenity during hypnotic meditation and are often pleasantly surprised to see the ongoing, life enhancing results. \n\nThank you greatly for your support, feel free to subscribe and comment on your great results, and I trust you will benefit from your time spent with positive hypnosis.\n\nPeace & Enjoy",
