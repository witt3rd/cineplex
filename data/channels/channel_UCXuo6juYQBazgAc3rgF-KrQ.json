      "description": "Welcome to Under the Big Tree! For more than 35 years, I have been composing, recording, and performing music in a variety of realms, but  always with a heavy technological emphasis. I deeply love analog synthesizers, as well as the electromechanical keyboards of the 70's, such as the Rhodes electric piano and Hammond organ. I've made a living continuously in sound design and music composition for interactive media for over two decades, and have been fortunate enough to work on some truly amazing franchises: Star Wars, X-Men, Guitar Hero, Mickey Mouse, and many more. I've always been a diehard DIY guy, and especially focus on building analog audio circuits, from outboard processing gear to Eurorack synthesizer modules.  I'm also a passionate analog tabletop board gamer, and really love anything that involves bringing people together in pursuit of a common goal. It's time to share some of that experience, so come on board and have a look!",
