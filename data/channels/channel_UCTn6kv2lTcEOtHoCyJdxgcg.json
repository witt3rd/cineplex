In virtually every town or city, there was at least one \"Beautiful Music\" or \"Easy Listening\" radio station, usually on the static-free F.M. band. In most areas, the \"Beautiful Music\" station was ranked at number one and, occasionally, number two in the market, behind the local \"rock\" station. The static-free, high-fidelity, stereo sound of the F.M radio band, was the perfect showcase for Mancini, Mantovani and Melachrino, as well as the Knightsbridge Strings, the Romantic Strings, the Living Strings, Percy Faith, Paul Mauriat, Frank DeVol, James Last, Caravelli, Raymond Lefevre, Les Baxter, Ronnie Aldrich, Franck Pourcel and many other great orchestras and musicians.\n\nI will never forget buying my first \"AM-FM\" Clock Radio so I could go to sleep by and awake with \"beautiful music #ProfHowdy",
