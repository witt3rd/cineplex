His first book, The Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness, debuted on the New York Times bestseller list and has been translated into over twenty languages.  In early June, 2011, Mingyur Rinpoche walked out of his monastery in Bodhgaya, India and began a \u2018wandering retreat\u2019 through the Himalayas and the plains of India that lasted four and a half years. When not attending to the monasteries under his care in India and Nepal, Rinpoche spends time each year traveling and teaching worldwide.\n\nFor more information on Mingyur Rinpoche or meditation, including a free video introduction to meditation course, visit tergar.org.",
