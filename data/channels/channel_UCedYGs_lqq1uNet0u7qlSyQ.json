      "description": "Welcome to the CrossExamined.org YouTube channel. We exist to cross-examine ideas against the truth of Christianity. Here you\u2019ll find content from the Cross Examined team lead by our founder & president Dr. Frank Turek, the co-author of the best-selling Christian apologetics book, \u2018I Don\u2019t Have Enough Faith to be An Atheist\u2019 (& several more). \n\nOur content includes Q&A clips from live college campus presentations around the country, debates with well-known atheists, interviews, podcast highlights, animation shorts, & our weekly Livestream show, \u2018Hope One\u2019. \n\nTopics we cover include addressing common misconceptions & objections made against the Bible, God, & Christianity. Demonstrating how historical, archaeological, scientific, & philosophical evidence all support what only the Christian worldview claims. We also discuss political & cultural movements that are incompatible with a Biblical worldview & how Christians can best navigate the cultural climate we find ourselves in today.\n\n",
