      "description": "My name is Chris, I'm a Catapult shooter and enthusiast. I enjoy competitive catapult shooting here in Ireland as well as travelling to England a few times each year to compete.\nI also enjoy slingshot hunting but for good reason. All animals are eaten and nothing is wasted, I understand that not everyone will share or understand my view on this and I respect that, so please respect that it's a passion of mine and it isn't just for the fun of it. All animals are hunted for a good free range meal.\nPlease note I am very experienced with a catapult and it takes a lot of practice before you are proficient enough to hunt, the last thing anyone wants is to be wounding animals and hunting unethically. I hope you enjoy my channel if you do then please hit that like button, drop me a comment and subscribe. People often ask me where they can buy good catapults so I've listed some links below of my top recommendations.",
