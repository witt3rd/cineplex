      "description": "I'm an atheist, but even more than that, I'm a skeptic. I have strict standards of evidence, and hold doubt as a virtue. To those skeptical toward religion: I urge you to apply similar rationality to the claims of alternative medicine and other pseudo-science. To religious individuals who are skeptical toward pseudo-science: I implore you to extend your skepticism into the realm of faith. Evaluate claims, demand evidence, scrutinize the absurd, and stay skeptical.\n\n\nThe email address below is for professional inquiries only.",
