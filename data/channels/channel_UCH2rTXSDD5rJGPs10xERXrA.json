      "description": "Physics is the most fundamental science which explains the universe.  No small task, right?  Sometimes it seems a little daunting, but I think you can do it! And I'm pleased to offer a little companionship along the way.\n\nThis channel contains 29 Modules covering the physics you'll see in high school AP Physics or introductory physics in college.  First Semester Mechanics: Modules 1-15.\nSecond Semester E&M: Modules 16-29.  \n\nThank you to all my Fandersons (TM) out there!  For you, I am revamping this channel to include all my squeak-free videos in a much more organized format. (I know, those squeaks were brutal.)  Hopefully you'll enjoy it. \n\nThere is also a donate link above, which will go to my kids' college fund and various charities. It's totally voluntary, but much appreciated.\n\nCheers,\nDr. A\n",
