      "description": "\nThe suggestion being made here is that you are not the separate individual self you experience yourself to be and that the sense of separation that may be  felt is artificial.  There is and never has been a separate individual \"you\".  You will never find what you are looking for as you are not there to find it and there is no \"it\" to find.  \n\u200b\nThis realisation (which is not personal realisation) is far beyond any description, it is immeasurably incomparable to any experience you may have had or hope to have.  It is the more significant shift that is possible for an apparently separate person and yet, paradoxically is totally and utterly ordinary.  It is ordinary simply because what you have been looking for all of your life is nothing other then what already is.   What you have always sought only seems to hide and it does so by already being everything.  \n\nFrom time to time meetings are held, words are written and videos get made.
