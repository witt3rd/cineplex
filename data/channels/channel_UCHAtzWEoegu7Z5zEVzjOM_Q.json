      "description": "Videos on a wide range of topics including complex networks, 3D printing, topology, computer programming, geometry, complexity theory, mathematical puzzles and research projects I've done professionally. \n\nI am fascinated by how complex forms/networks can arise from simple rules (e.g., cellular automata, network rewriting), These `complex forms' often make for good 3D printing. I am very interested in discovering, designing and 3D scanning various forms for 3D printing. I show how to use programs like tinkercad and mathematica to create 3D forms and other things.\n\nI've included a series of videos about topology -aimed at a general audience, and I've made videos on non-euclidean geometry, and about how to visualize hyperbolic geometry and explore it using software. I have also done a series about math puzzles and unsolved problems. \n\nThere are also videos on using complex systems to make technology, on set theory, game theory, wireless networks and even chess grand masters,",
