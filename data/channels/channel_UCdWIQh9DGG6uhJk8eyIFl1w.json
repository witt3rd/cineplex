Thank you for your charitable and kind hearted support.\n\nCome on the journey to explicate Theories of Everything, consciousness, rationality, and God. \n\nI'm Curt Jaimungal, a Torontonian filmmaker making a documentary on the above topics (as for what shape the final settled project will take, I'm unsure). During the exploratory phase, there will be a plethora of interviews / conversations with intellectuals placed on this channel -- approximately un-edited.\n\nThere's also the documentary I directed / wrote just released April 2021, called Better Left Unsaid (http://betterleftunsaidfilm.com/) on the topic of \"when does the left go too far?\"\n",
