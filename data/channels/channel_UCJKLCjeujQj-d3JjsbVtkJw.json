      "description": "Hello internet! I'm Sam Wronski and welcome to World of Zero. This is a channel all about software development. This channel is all about recording the design and development of various software and games. We'll look into developing games in Unity, building apps for phones and more! Unlike normal development tutorials, a lot of what we develop here is not scripted and I have not done it before. There is a lot to be gained from mistakes, arguably more than success, and the goal of World of Zero is to highlight that.\n\nI'm always open to suggestions and feedback is always welcome. Let's make something awesome!\n\nVideo's are uploaded once a day Monday through Friday with the occasional extra in between.",
