Each week we explore the world of tech--and the people and companies that change it. Our channel casts a wide net: rockets, spacecraft, ordinary household tech, computing devices, tech games, and vehicles are among the possibilities. We'll try to have a little fun along the way, and hopefully you'll find the content entertaining and educational too.",
