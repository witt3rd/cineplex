While I do build projects, most episodes focus on showing you HOW things work, so you can use the information to bring your own designs to life.\n\nEvery video has a corresponding article on my website at http://dronebotworkshop.com , along with the diagrams and code samples you\u2019ll need to build your own creations.  You can also participate in discussions on my Forum at https://forum.dronebotworkshop.com.\n\nPlease note that I no longer do any sponsored videos, enquiries for these will be ignored!\n\nIf you'd like to know more about me or the DroneBot Workshop you can read the FAQ at https://dronebotworkshop.com/about-dronebot-workshop/faq/\n\nAnd if you have technical questions please ask them on the Forum.\n\nWelcome to the Workshop!
