      "description": "Super-producer Timbaland has stamped his indelible imprint on the music scene since the mid-1990s.  His production has helped create career-defining hits for artists such as Jodeci, Aaliyah, Ginuwine, Missy Elliott, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Jay-Z, among many others.  Respected beyond the genres of urban and hip hop music, Timbaland, whose musical influences cross cultural lines, has also been sought by diverse superstars whose music similarly knows no boundaries, from pop star Justin Timberlake to avant-singer Bjork. Released December 25, 2015 is his latest mixtape King Stays King.",
