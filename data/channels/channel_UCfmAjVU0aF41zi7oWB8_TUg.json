I run the NewJazz project by myself and I do not make a business concept out of it (no sponsors or merchandise either). I read all of your comments and I try hard to answer all of your questions. I love to be in touch.\n\nApproximately by the end of every month I'll upload a NewJazz lesson. All my lessons are designed so that you can approach them in NO specific order. I try to make them all start out easy. If a lesson becomes too advanced (or weird), just skip to another one.
