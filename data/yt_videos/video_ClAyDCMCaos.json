    "title": "\"Wu Hsin\" (Part 7a) a.k.a. Roy Melvyn - Powerful Pointers to the Truth - Non-Duality",
    "description": "\"Wu Hsin\" (meaning No Mind)  was a fictitious character created by Roy Melvyn to create and structure a series of pith teachings and pointers to the Absolute, based on key non-duality teachings. Despite the controversy around the \"deceit\" in publishing these works as words from an  \"authentic\" Chinese Master, I have chosen to upload these readings as they are some of the clearest pointers I have read. Please be aware of the context as to how they were created. In essence, we are all really imaginary \"persons\" anyway!\n\nRoy Melvyn (1947-2017) was born in Brooklyn, New York. These pointers were taken from the book: \"Solving Yourself\". All of Melvyn's books can be purchased on Amazon.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
