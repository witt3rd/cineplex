    "title": "Venerable Ajahn Chah - \"On Meditation\" - Thai Forest Theravada Buddhism",
    "description": "Ajahn Chah  was a Thai Buddhist monk. He was an influential teacher of the Buddhadhamma and a founder of two major monasteries in the Thai Forest Tradition. He was reputed to be an Arahant.\n\nRespected and loved in his own country as a man of great wisdom, he was also instrumental in establishing Theravada Buddhism in the West. Beginning in 1979 with the founding of Cittaviveka (commonly known as Chithurst Buddhist Monastery) in the United Kingdom, the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah has spread throughout Europe, the United States and the British Commonwealth. The dhamma talks of Ajahn Chah have been recorded, transcribed and translated into several languages. He left behind a legacy of dhamma talks, students, and monasteries.\n\nPlease note that all of my recordings can be downloaded via my Google Drive site, details of which can be found under the COMMUNITY tab of the main page of my YT channel.",
