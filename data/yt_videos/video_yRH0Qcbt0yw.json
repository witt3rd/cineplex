    "description": "\u201cThe Record of the Heart-felt Advice of the Dakini, Indestructible Glorious Lamp\u201d - by Ayu Khandro\nTranslated by James Low\n\nAyu Khandro (Long Life Dakini), also known as Dorje Paldr\u00f6n, lived from 1839 to 1953 (114 years). She was a practitioner, yogini, and terton of Tibetan Buddhism in Eastern Tibet. An accomplished Dzogchen meditator, she is renowned for her extensive pilgrimages throughout Tibet, long periods of dark retreat practice, the gongter of the practice of the yidam Senge Dongma (the Lion-Faced Dakini), various forms of Ch\u00f6d, and her lifelong dedication to spiritual practice.\nShe led the life of a hidden yogini, spending a significant amount of her life in retreat or as a wandering chodma. She was recognised as an emanation of Vajrayogini. \n\nArt work of Ayu Khankdro by Kay Kondrad -  https://dakiniasart.org/shop/ayu-khandro-art-print-kay-konrad/\nMusic: Mettaverse - Regenerative Spiritual Reset\n\n___________________________________________________\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
