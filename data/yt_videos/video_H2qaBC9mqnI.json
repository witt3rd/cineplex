    "description": "A reading from the teaching entitled \"Advice to King Trisong Detusen\" - from the text \"Advice from the  Lotus Born\", by Padmasambhava - translated by Erik Pema Kunsang.\n\nIn Tibetan, Guru Padmasambhava is generally referred to as Guru Rinpoche, which means \u201cprecious master.\u201d Guru Rinpoche is a totally enlightened being, a fully awakened one, a buddha. He did not become enlightened gradually, or start practicing the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni and eventually achieve enlightenment. Guru Rinpoche incarnated as a fully enlightened being. Through his form, primordial wisdom manifests in the world to benefit all sentient beings. Buddha Shakyamuni actually predicted Guru Padmasambhava\u2019s appearance. Nineteen different sutras and tantras contain clear predictions of his arrival and activities.\n\nMusic: Meditation Music 432HZ by BEEBS - with thanks to Beebs for the gift of his music for this channel.\n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
