    "description": "THE  FIVE  TEXTS  translated  into  English  in  this  book  are considered  the  first  transmission  of  Dzogchen  Ati  to Tibet.  They  were  transmitted  by  a  Tibetan  monk  called Vairotsana who distinguished himself not only in the field of  translation,  emerging  as  the  greatest  of  the  Tibetan lotsa-was,  but  also  as  a  traveler  and  pilgrim  who  left  the Land of the Snows for the hills of the Hindu Kush to bring back  a  canon  of  Dzogchen  texts  from  its  closely  guarded source.  Returning  from  Oddiyana,  where  he  had  received the  transmission  of  Dzogchen  Ati  from  Shri  Singha,  he immediately translated these five tantras into Tibetan, and they  became  known  as  the  Five  Early  Transmissions  or Translations (snga \u2019gyur nga). They constitute the root and essence  of  Dzogchen  in  Tibet\u2014basic,  raw  Dzogchen precepts   that   are   appropriately   designated   \u201cradical Dzogchen.\u201d\n\nTranslated by Keith Dowman.\nThe book can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.com.au/Original-Perfection-Vairotsanas-Early-Transmissions/dp/0861716809\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
