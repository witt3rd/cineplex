    "title": "Jean Klein - A Meditation on Love and Relationships - Advaita-Vedanta",
    "description": "Reflections on love and relationships, along with a poem by Jean Klein - taken from the text \"The Book of Listening\".\n\nJean Klein (October 19, 1912 \u2013 February 22, 1998) was a French author, spiritual teacher and philosopher of Advaita Vedanta (Nondualism). He was born in Berlin and spent his childhood in Brno and Prague. Having left Germany in 1933 for France, he secretly worked with the French Resistance in the Second World War. Klein was a musicologist and doctor, traveled to India where he was influenced by Sri Atmananda Krishna Menon, studied Kashmir Shaivism and was sent to the West to teach Advaita Vedanta. He is regarded as one most eloquent communicators of non-duality in the second half of the 20th century. \n\nMusic: Time for Peace - Everything Returns\nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this exquisite music for this channel.
