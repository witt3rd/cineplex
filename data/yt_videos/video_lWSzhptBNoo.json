    "description": "Sun Bu'er (Sun Pu-erh, Chinese: \u5b6b\u4e0d\u4e8c), one of the Taoist Seven Masters of Quanzhen, lived c. 1119\u20131182 C.E. in the Shandong province of China.  At the age of 51 she took up the study of the Dao and became a disciple of Wang Chongyang, serving as a Taoist priestess. She eventually left her home and traveled to the city of Luoyang where after twelve years of practice, at Fengxiangu cave, she attained the Dao and, it is said, became an immortal. Sun was a teacher with several disciples, founding the Purity and Tranquility School, and wrote many poems.\n\nThe 6 poems read here can be found on this website: https://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/Poets/S/SunBuer/index.html\n\nMusic: Eduardo Arenas \n_________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
