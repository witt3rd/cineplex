    "title": "Transforming Suffering and Happiness - A Meditation - The Third Dodrupchen Rinpoche - Dzogchen",
    "description": "This clear and direct teaching on developing equanimity and understanding relative and Ultimate truth was given by Dodrupchen Jikm\u00e9 Tenp\u00e9 Nyima, the Third Dodrupchen Rinpoche (1865-1926). He was one of the most outstanding Tibetan masters of his time and the teacher of many great lamas, including Jamyang Khyents\u00e9 Ch\u00f6kyi Lodr\u00f6. He is held in the highest esteem by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who calls him \u201ca great scholar and a remarkable yogi\u201d. The writings of the Third Dodrupchen are one of the main sources used by His Holiness in his personal studies of Dzogchen, and he quotes him frequently in his teachings.\nTranslated by: Adam Pearcey\nThe full teaching/text can be found here: https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/dodrupchen-III/transforming-suffering-and-happiness\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
