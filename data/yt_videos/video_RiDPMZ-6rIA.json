    "description": "Selected \"Songs of Realization\" by Khenpo Rinpoche  (all translated by Ari Goldfield).\n\nKhenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche is one of the foremost living teachers of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, a great scholar and master of meditation.  He teaches widely in the West, often through songs of realization, his own as well as those composed by Milarepa and other masters of the past. \"Ts\u00fcltrim Gyamtso\" translates to English as \"Ocean of Ethical Conduct\". Khenpo Rinpoche demonstrates the carefree life of a yogin, singing spontaneous songs of realisation wherever he goes, devoted only to the welfare of others.\n\nOriginal music by Maok - with deep thanks to Maok for collaborating on this special project.\nPlease find more of Maok's music at his following sites:\nhttps://www.maok.sk/eshop/store.php\u200b\u200b\nhttps://maokmusic.bandcamp.com/\u200b\u200b\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
