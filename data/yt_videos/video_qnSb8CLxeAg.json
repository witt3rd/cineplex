    "description": "The Heart S\u016btra is a key  sutra in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. Its Sanskrit title, Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101h\u1e5bdaya, can be translated as \"The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom\".\n\nThe sutra famously states, \"Form is empty\" (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). It is a condensed expos\u00e9 on the Buddhist Mahayana teaching of the Two Truths doctrine, which says that ultimately all phenomena are sunyata, empty of an unchanging essence. This emptiness is a 'characteristic' of all phenomena, and not a transcendent reality, but also \"empty\" of an essence of its own. Specifically, it is a response to Sarvastivada teachings that \"phenomena\" or its constituents are real.\n\nMusic by Meditative Mind and Deva Premal\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
