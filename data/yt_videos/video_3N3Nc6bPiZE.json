    "description": "R\u0101bi\u02bba al-\u02bbAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya  or simply Rabi\u02bfa al-Basri (approx. 717\u2013801 C.E.) was a female Muslim Sufi saint, considered by some to be the first true saint in the Sufi tradition. She was born  in Basra, Iraq, of the Qays tribe. Little is known of her life apart from her piety, popularity with men and women followers of the Sufi path, and her refusal to marry. She was orphaned then sold as a slave in her youth then set free by her Master to practice devotion and to engage in prayer. Rabi\u2019a Basri made one of the greatest contributions towards the development of Sufism.\n\nMusic:  Nuits blanches - Mohamed Rouane - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfGrQf2nhxM\n _________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
