    "description": "A selection of poems from Hanshan - formatted for meditation. Translated by A. S. Kline.\n \nThe poet Hanshan \u5bd2\u5c71, a name meaning \u201cCold Mountain,\u201d ranks as one of the most eccentric and mysterious figures of Chinese literature. He is said to have lived during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), dwelling in a cave or hut in Tiantai Mountain near modern-day Taizhou, Zhejiang. In Chinese and Japanese art, he is often depicted as dirty and raggedy, smiling mischievously with his friend Shide \u62fe\u5f97. His poetry, written in a direct, colloquial style, was satirical and spiritual, touching on both Buddhist and Daoist themes. Hanshan also wrote poems about his own life, but his real identity is completely unknown. His name, in fact, is a pseudonym that refers to a place in Tiantai Mountain. In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, Hanshan and his sidekick Shide are honored as emanations of the bodhisattvas Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b and Samantabhadra, respectively. Little is known of his work, since he was a recluse living in a remote region and his poems were written on rocks in the mountains he called home.\n\nMost of the poems read in this reading can be found here: https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Chinese/HanShan.php\n\nMusic: Time for Peace - \"Tuis and Flute\"\nThis beautiful music can be purchased and downloaded here:  \nhttps://soundcloud.com/madhuram or here:\nhttps://www.timeforpeace.bandcamp.com \n\nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this exquisite music for this channel.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
