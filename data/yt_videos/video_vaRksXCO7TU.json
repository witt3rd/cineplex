    "title": "(No Music) - Padmasambhava - SELF-LIBERATION THROUGH SEEING WITH NAKED AWARENESS - Dzogchen",
    "description": "A text belonging to the same cycle as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, this instruction on the method of  self-liberation presents the essence of Dzogchen, The Great Perfection, regarded in Tibet as the highest and most esoteric teaching of the Buddha. Teaching the attainment of Buddhahood in a single lifetime, this text was written and concealed by Guru Padmasambhava in the eighth century and rediscovered six centuries later by Karma Lingpa. Translated by John Reynolds.\n\nThe root text can be found here: http://www.buddhism.org/Sutras/2/Awareness.htm\n\nThe text which includes a detailed commentary can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.com.au/Self-Liberation-through-Seeing-Naked-Awareness-ebook/dp/B0062ZBHIQ\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
