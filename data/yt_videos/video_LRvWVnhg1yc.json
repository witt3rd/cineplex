    "description": "Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad R\u016bm\u012b  (30 September 1207 \u2013 17 December 1273), was a 13th-century Persian poet, faqih, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic originally from Greater Khorasan in Greater Iran. Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions.\n\nMusic: Please see all details below under video descriptor.
