    "description": "A pinnacle teaching! This profound and sublime teaching by the Great Master, Longchenpa, is suitable and intended for experienced meditators who have an in depth understanding and practical insight into Dzogchen's perfection. \n\nLongchenpa's teaching on the Three Aspects of Meditative Absorption - read from the text: A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission.
