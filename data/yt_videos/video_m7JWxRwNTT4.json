    "description": "Selected excerpts of teachings taken from Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna and Gospel of Ramakrishna.\n\nSri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa  (18 February 1836 \u2013 16 August 1886)  was an Indian Hindu mystic, saint, and religious leader in 19th century Bengal. Sri Ramakrishna experienced spiritual ecstasies from a young age, and was influenced by several religious traditions, including devotion toward the Goddess Kali, Tantra, Bhakti and Advaita Vedanta.\n\nAs a priest at the Dakshineshwar Kali Temple, his mystical temperament and ecstasies gradually gained him widespread acknowledgement, attracting to him various spiritual teachers, social leaders, and lay followers; he eventually taught disciples, who would later form the monastic Ramakrishna Order.\n\nMusic: Sahaja Yoga - Raga for Vishuddhi - Jayjaywanti \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tna5UXzJLkM&t=142s&ab_channel=AakashGupta\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
