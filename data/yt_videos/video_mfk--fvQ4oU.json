    "description": "Selected verses from \"The Flowing light of the Godhead \" - Translated by Frank Tobin and the text \"Enduring Grace - Living Portraits of Seven Women Mystics  by Carol Lee Flinders\n\nMechthild of Magdeburg (c. 1207 \u2013 c. 1282/1294), a Beguine, was a Christian medieval mystic, whose book Das flie\u00dfende Licht der Gottheit (The Flowing Light of Divinity) described her visions of God. She was the first mystic to write in German, as she did not know how to write in Latin. Definite biographical information about Mechthild is scarce; what is known of her life comes largely from scattered hints in her work. She was born in a noble Saxon family. She had her first vision of the Holy Spirit at the age of twelve. In 1230 she left her home and \u201crenounced worldly honour and worldly riches\u201d to become a Beguine at Magdeburg. \n\nHer criticism of church dignitaries, religious laxity and claims to theological insight aroused so much opposition that some called for the burning of her writings.\n\nMusic: Album - 1 Hour of Heavenly Choral Music from Renaissance & Baroque - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57BAevesxyI&t=873s\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
