    "description": "Dudjom Yeshe Dorje  (1904-1987) \u2014 one of Tibet\u2019s foremost yogins, scholars, and meditation masters.  Considered to be the living representative of Padmasambhava, he was a great revealer of the \u2018treasures\u2019 (terma) concealed by Padmasambhava. A prolific author and meticulous scholar, Dudjom Rinpoche wrote more than forty volumes, one of the best known of which is his monumental The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History. Over the last decade of his life he spent much time teaching in the West, where he helped to establish the Nyingma tradition, founding major centres in France and the United States. \n\nReading taken from the book - Quintessential Dzogchen: Confusion Dawns as Wisdom - translated by Erik Pema Kunsang and Marcia Binder Schmidt.\nBook can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.com.au/Quintessential-Dzogchen-Confusion-Dawns-Wisdom/dp/9627341584\n\nMusic credits: Blank Embrace - www.bandcamp.com\n_______________________________________________\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
