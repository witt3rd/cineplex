    "description": "Dear Dharma friends, this is the guided metta meditation I gave - extracted from the recent \"Livestream\" meeting as requested. It includes the readings from the Metta Sutta as taught by the Buddha - the 11 advantages of practicing metta meditation and the Buddha's words on Loving Kindness. Also, there are now more silent spaces so that you can enjoy a longer meditation.\n\nMay you all well, happy and peaceful - free from fear, anxiety, and all the afflictions.\n\nWith much metta \ud83c\udf3a\ud83d\udc9c",
