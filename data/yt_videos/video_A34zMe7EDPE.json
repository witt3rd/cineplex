    "description": "Tilopa's classic 6 words of advice for meditation - translated by Ken McLeod. Ken McLeod has translated the text in two ways: a version that\u2019s as concise and literal as possible, and a version that\u2019s slightly more elaborate but does a better job of unpacking the meaning embedded in those six Tibetan words.\nYou can find the text written out here: https://www.rootlesswanderer.com/buddhism/tilopas-six-words-of-advice/\nThe commentary is by Lama Tashi Namgyal - Shenpen \u00d6sel Magazine - Volume 1 - Issue 2\n\nTilopa (988\u20131069) was born in Bengal in India. He was a tantric practitioner and mahasiddha. He practised Anuttarayoga Tantra, a set of spiritual practices intended to accelerate the process of attaining Buddhahood. Naropa is considered his main student.  It is believed Tilopa received Mahamudra teachings from primordial Buddha Vajradhara himself \u2013 the primordial essence of all things, the absolute Wisdom and Compassion.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Sincere gratitude to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of appreciation for these recordings.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
