    "description": "** Disclaimer: there is some debate over the authenticity of Al-Ghazali's \"original words\" which have been tampered with since the 13th century. Please keep this in mind and take these words in this context. The meaning, of course, is more important.\n\nAl-Ghazali (c.\u20091058 \u2013 19 December 1111) was a Persian philosopher who was one of the most prominent and influential Muslim philosophers, theologians, jurists, and mystics of Sunni Islam.\n\nMost Muslims consider him to be a Mujaddid, a renewer of the faith who, \naccording to the prophetic hadith, appears once every century to restore the faith of the ummah (\"the Islamic Community\"). His works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that al-Ghazali was awarded the honorific title \"Proof of Islam\". Al-Ghazali believed that the Islamic spiritual tradition had declined and that the spiritual sciences taught by the first generation of Muslims had been forgotten.\n\nImage: Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0\nMusic: Huesyni Persriv and A.Kyriazis\nIslamic Call to Prayer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe8qRj12OhY\n_________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
