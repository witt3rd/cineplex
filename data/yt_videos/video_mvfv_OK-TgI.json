    "title": "Who Am I? (Nan Yar?) - The Teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi",
    "description": "\u201cWho am I?\u201d is the title given to a set of questions and answers bearing on Self-enquiry. The questions were put to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi by  Sri M. Sivaprakasam Pillai around the year 1902.\nTranslated by Dr. T. M. P. MAHADEVAN \n\nI have omitted most of the questions for ease of flow - the answers are direct in answering the questions.\nPlease note that all of my recordings can be downloaded via my Google Drive, details of which can be found under the COMMUNITY tab of the main page of my You Tube channel.\n\n\u00a0Music by: Meditative Mind - Tibetan Bowls - 396Hz\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
