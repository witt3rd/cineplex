    "description": "A deep, powerful, and profound teaching intended especially for those facing death or illness - all of us! The talk is entitled  \"A Good Dose of Dhamma\" - taken from the book \"An Unentangled Knowing\" - translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.\n\nThe full text can be downloaded here: https://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/An-Unentangled-Knowing-Lessons-in-Training-the-Mind.pdf\n\nUpasika Kee Nanayon or Kor Khao-suan-luang was a realized female practitioner from Thailand. She was mostly self-taught, reading the Pali canon and other Buddhist literature. She considered the Buddha's Dhamma as her primary teacher. Her dhamma talks and poetry were widely circulated. As word of her spread, she became one of the most popular meditation teachers in Thailand. This, and many of her talks, have been translated into English by Thanissaro Bhikkhu who sees her as \"arguably the foremost woman Dhamma teacher in twentieth-century Thailand.\"\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
