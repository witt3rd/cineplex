    "description": "The Zen master, Shiwu \u77f3\u5c4b, or Stonehouse (1272\u20131352) was a Chinese Chan poet and hermit monk who lived during the Yuan Dynasty. He was considered one of the greatest Chinese Buddhist poets and used poetry as his medium of instruction for Dharma. \nIn 1312 at the age of forty he moved to Xiamu Mountain near Huzhou to live as a hermit and it is here that he composed his \"Mountain Poems\" (Shan-shih), one-hundred and eighty-four verses expounding Dharma and the facets of living in the mountains.\nNear the end of his life, monks asked him to record what he found of interest on his mountain; Stonehouse delivered to them hundreds of poems and an admonition: \"Do not try singing these poems. Only if you sit on them will they do you any good.\"\n\nTranslated by Red Pine (Bill Porter)\n\nMusic: Nay Sunrise\nAdrian Freedman - Handpan and Shakuhachi \n\u261b https://adrianfreedman.bandcamp.com/ \n\u261b https://soundcloud.com/adrianfreedman\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
