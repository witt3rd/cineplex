    "description": "This work by Shankaracharya was translated into Tamil prose by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi while he was still living in Virupaksha Cave. It is a very free translation, even the order of the paragraphs being changed to some extent. \n\nThe Vivekachudamani is an introductory treatise within the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism. For many centuries has been celebrated as a teaching manual of Advaita. The Hindu tradition attributes it to Adi Shankara of the eighth century CE.\n\nMusic credits: Meditative Mind - www.bandcamp.com",
