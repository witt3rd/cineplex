    "description": "Excerpts read from the teaching, \"The Supersensual Life.\" Transcribed by Wayne Kraus \nThe full text of the teaching can be found here: http://www.jacobboehmeonline.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/THE_SUPERSENSUAL_LIFE.6243904.pdf\n\nJakob B\u00f6hme (April 1575 \u2013 17 November 1624) was a German philosopher, Christian mystic, and Lutheran Protestant theologian. He was considered an original thinker by many of his contemporaries within the Lutheran tradition, and his first book, commonly known as Aurora, caused a great scandal.  B\u00f6hme had a profound influence on later philosophical movements such as German idealism and German Romanticism. Hegel described B\u00f6hme as \"the first German philosopher\".\n______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.
