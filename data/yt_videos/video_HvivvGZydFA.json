    "title": "Marguerite Porete - Selected Verses from \"The Mirror of Simple Souls\" - Christian Mystics",
    "description": "Marguerite Porete (13th century \u2013 1 June 1310) was a French-speaking mystic and the author of The Mirror of Simple Souls, a work of Christian mysticism dealing with the workings of agape (divine love). She was burnt at the stake for heresy in Paris in 1310 after a lengthy trial, refusing to remove her book from circulation or recant her views. It was reported in a chronicle that the crowd was moved to tears by the calmness of how she faced her end.\n\nPorete's life is recorded only in accounts of her trial for heresy, at which she was condemned to be burnt at the stake. Porete's biography is probably biased and certainly incomplete. She was said to come from the County of Hainaut, a French-speaking principality in the Holy Roman Empire, though this is uncertain. Her high level of education means she is likely to have had upper-class origins. She is associated with the beguine movement and was therefore able to travel fairly freely.\n\nArt image - \"Ellipsis Halo \" by Dan Hillier used with kind permission of the artist.\nPlease see Dan's incredible art at: https://danhillier.com/\nMusic: The Sounds of Angels Libera - Ave Maria (Caccini) - Tom Cully (800% slowed)\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
