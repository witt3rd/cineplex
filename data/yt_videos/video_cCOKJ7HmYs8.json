    "description": "Excerpts from the teaching/chapter, \"Recognising the Thinker\" taken from the text \"As It Is\" - Volume 1. Translated by Erik Pema Kunsang. \n\nTulku Urgyen Rinpoche (1920 - February 13, 1996) was a Buddhist master of the Kagy\u00fc and Nyingma lineages who lived at Nagi Gompa hermitage in Nepal.
