    "description": "This video is an introduction to Galois Theory, which spells out a beautiful correspondence between fields and their symmetry groups.  \n\n__\n\nSOURCES and REFERENCES for Further Reading!\n\nThis video is a quick-and-dirty introduction to Galois theory. But as with any quick introduction, there are details that I gloss over for the sake of brevity. To learn these details rigorously, I've listed a few resources down below.\n \n(a) Galois Theory \n\nGalois Theory notes by Tom Leinster: These notes are by far the best resource out there for learning the subject. They\u2019re completely rigorous, but they\u2019re also written in a very reader-friendly way with lots of examples and motivation. (See link here: https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/gt/gt.pdf)\n\nThis playlist on Galois Theory by Professor Richard Borcherds is a gem. It explains Galois Theory from the ground up, rigorously, in almost complete generality. (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yHsr3EFj53Zxu3iRGMYL_89GDMvdkgt) \n\n(b) Group Theory\n\nGroup Theory lectures: This playlist by Professor Benedict Gross is a beauty. It goes through the entire group theory syllabus from the ground up, and Professor Gross is a masterful lecturer.
