    "description": "Sheik Abol-Hasan of Kharaqan is one of the master Sufis of Iran - considered a Sufi's Sufi.\nHe was born in 963 from Persian parents in Khorasan and died on the day of Ashura in 1033. He is not as well known or as widely as some of the great Muslim saints from Khorasan-Attar, Rumi, or Bahaoddin Naqhshband. However, this near anonymity was deliberate, according to the Sheikh's wish when he lived. Despite being a hidden saint, his spiritual affinity and grace are still very much acknowledged among the living Sufi circles across Iran and in the region. Even today, a steady stream of dervish pilgrims visits his tomb in Iran. His enduring presence is still potent among those whose aim in life is to attain higher knowledge and refinement of the heart. \n\nSelected Poems from the \"The Soul and a Loaf of Bread\" - Renditions by Vraje Abramian.\nThe book can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.com/Soul-Loaf-Bread-Teachings-Abol-Hasan-ebook/dp/B00QLH94XU\n\n Music:  Time for Peace - \"Sufi Prayer\"\nThis beautiful music can be purchased and downloaded here:   https://www.timeforpeace.bandcamp.com\nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this exquisite music for this channel.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
