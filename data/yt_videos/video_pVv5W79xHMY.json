    "description": "These poems have been selected from the text \"The Gift\" - translated by Daniel Ladinsky.\n\nPersian lyric poet Hafiz (born Khw\u0101ja \u0160amsu d-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101fez-e \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b) grew up in Shiraz. Very little is known about his life, but it is thought that he may have memorized the Qur\u2019an after hearing his father recite passages. He is one of the most celebrated of the Persian poets, and his influence can be felt to this day. As the author of numerous ghazals expressing love, spirituality, and protest, he and his work continue to be important to Iranians, and many of his poems are used as proverbs or sayings.\n\nMusic by Maok - The Song of my Soul; Fibres of Light; Infinite Forgiveness\nWith deep thanks to Maok for the use of his beautiful, transcendent music on these readings. Please find more of Maok's music at his following sites:\nhttps://www.maok.sk/eshop/store.php\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://maokmusic.bandcamp.com/\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
