    "description": "A selection of Kabir quotes and pointers intended for contemplation and meditation. Includes the song lyrics written by Snatam Kaur about and for Kabir. Kabir says: \" Sing such a song with all of your heart that you'll never have to sing again.\"\n\nKabir Das was a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint, whose writings influenced Hinduism's Bhakti movement and his verses are found in Sikhism's scripture Guru Granth Sahib. His early life was in a Muslim family, but he was strongly influenced by his teacher, the Hindu bhakti leader Ramananda. Kabir was born in the Indian city of Varanasi but spent most of his life in the city of Faridabad near Delhi.\n\nMusic credits:\nVa, vis et deviens - Armand Amar \nSecret Four - Anousheh, Tom \nSnatam Kaur - \"Kabir's Song\"\n\nPlease note: all of my recordings can be download via my Google Drive site, details under the COMMUNITY tab.\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
