    "description": "Persian lyric poet Hafiz (born Khw\u0101ja \u0160amsu d-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad H\u0101fez-e \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b) grew up in Shiraz. Very little is known about his life, but it is thought that he may have memorized the Qur\u2019an after hearing his father recite passages. He is one of the most celebrated of the Persian poets, and his influence can be felt to this day. As the author of numerous ghazals expressing love, spirituality, and protest, he and his work continue to be important to Iranians, and many of his poems are used as proverbs or sayings.\n\nSelected poems from Daniel Ladinsky's book - \"I heard God Laughing.\" (I am aware of the controversy around Ladinsky's translations so please listen in this context!)\n\nMusic: Levon Minassian and Armand Amar - 'You Are'\nEl Hadra - 'The Mystic Dance'\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
