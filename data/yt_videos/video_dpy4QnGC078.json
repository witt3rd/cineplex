    "title": "The Avadhuta Gita - \"Self and Reality\" - Advaita-Vedanta",
    "description": "Readings from first section on \"Self and Reality\". The Avadhuta Gita is attributed to the sage Dattatreya, who spontaneously sang it after purifying himself in meditation and becoming absorbed in the uninterrupted bliss of Reality. It is regarded as one of the greatest treatise on Advaita Vedanta and some scholars date it as far back as 5000 B.C. \n\nThe word \"avadhut\" refers to one who has renounced all worldly attachments and connections and lives in a state beyond body consciousness. They have shaken off all cares and concerns, possessions and positions, along with all concepts and labels that interfere with his direct perception of Reality. \nThe full teaching can be found here: https://www.inner-quest.org/Avadhuta.htm\n\nMusic: Deeply Divine Meditation 111HZ - Mettaverse\n______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
