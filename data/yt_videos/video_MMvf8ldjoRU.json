    "description": "This work by Shankaracharya was translated into Tamil prose by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi while he was still living in Virupaksha Cave. It is a very free translation, even the order of the paragraphs being changed to some extent.\n\nThe Vivekachudamani is an introductory treatise within the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism.  For many centuries has been celebrated as a teaching manual of Advaita. The Hindu tradition attributes it to Adi Shankara of the eighth century CE.\n\nMusic by: Meditative Mind - www.bandcamp.com\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
