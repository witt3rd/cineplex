    "description": "After five attacks and millions of dollars lost due to an exploit, this week we're diving deep into the mechanism behind what made this possible: Flash Loans. Some called it a magnificent attack, some called it art. But there are other important questions to be asked: were the flash loan attack prevention, fake token attack prevention, re-entrance attack prevention claims unwarranted?
