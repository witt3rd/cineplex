    "description": "The Ten Ox Herding Pictures  is a series of short poems and accompanying drawings used in the Zen tradition to describe the stages of a practitioner's progress toward enlightenment, and his or her return to society to enact wisdom and compassion.  The Ten Oxherding Pictures which relate back to a Ch'an master in the Sung dynasty China (1126-1279 AD), have spiritual roots in the early Buddhist texts. They provide useful imagery of an illusion to be negated before a seeker of truth can experience enlightenment. The ox symbolize the mind and the herder symbolizes the seeker.\n\nCommentary by Yamada Mumom.\nTranslated by Victor Sogen Hori\n\nMumon Yamada (July 16, 1900 \u2013 December 24, 1988) was a Rinzai roshi, calligrapher, and former abbot of Sh\u014dfuku-ji in Kobe, Japan. Mumon was also the former head of the My\u014dshin-ji branch of the Rinzai school of Japan. \n\nMusic: Kyorei - Empty Bell \u00b7 Stan Richardson\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
