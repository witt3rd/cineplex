    "title": "The Eight Direction Perception Meditation - Guided Taoist, Tai Chi Meditation",
    "description": "The Eight Direction Perception meditation was cultivated on the Wudang Mountains in Ancient China. This esoteric training allowed the Taoist Monks to expand their perceptual awareness and increase their psychic ability. \n\nThrough the complexities of modern society, many of us have numbed our abilities to feel our own emotions, internal energies and the subtle powers and intentions that permeate our existence. This meditation releases the trapped emotional memory and stagnant energy lodged in the tissues of the body that inhibit our sensory functioning. The latter part of the meditation is devoted to stimulating and balancing the left and right hemispheres of the brain. This will unleash newfound levels of intuition and creativity.",
