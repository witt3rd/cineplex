    "description": "The Brihad Aranyaka  Upanishad is one of the principal Upanishads. It is part of the Shatpath Brahmana of the Shukla or the White Yajur Veda. It is generally regarded as the oldest, as the most elaborate and as the most important of all  the Upanishads. Its name literally means 'great forest of knowledge'.Its central theme is the Great, the Infinite, the Imperishable Braham identified with the Self, with the Atman.\nPenguin edition published in 1966 - Translated by Juan Mascaro.\n\nMusic: Chakra drone Music - Macroform\n______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
