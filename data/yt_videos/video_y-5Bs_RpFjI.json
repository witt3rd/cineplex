    "description": "An extract of Longchenpa's teaching focusing on the emptiness of all phenomena from the Trilogy of Rest.\n\"When appearances, vividly present to awareness, are not recognized for what they are, these same hallucinatory events seem true. But they are just like castles in the clouds. For within the state of awareness, they are simply the clear appearance of what does not exist. They are void of basis and intrinsic being, of ground and root. On the other hand, when they are recognized for what they are, they are simply seen as empty forms, for they have no substance. As the s\u016btra tells us, \u201cAll compounded things resemble castles in the clouds.\u201d \n~ Longchenpa\n\nLongchenpa, also known as Longchen Rabjam \u2018Infinite, Vast Expanse of Space\u2019, or Drim\u00e9 \u00d6zer (1308-1364), was one of the most brilliant teachers of the Nyingma lineage. He systematized the Nyingma teachings in his \u2018Seven Treasures\u2019 and wrote extensively on Dzogchen.    \n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
