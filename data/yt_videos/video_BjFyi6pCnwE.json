    "description": "Selected teachings and quotes from Tsokknyi Rinpoche from the text \"Open Heart, Open Mind.\"\n\nTsoknyi Rinpoche or Ngawang Tsoknyi Gyatso (born 13 March 1966) is a Nepalese Tibetan Buddhist teacher and author, and the founder of the Pundarika Foundation. He is considered to be the third in a line of reincarnate lamas, the first of whom was a lama in Eastern Tibet in the last century. The first Tsoknyi Rinpoche was known for perseverance and effort in his meditation practice, and he also founded a large nunnery. The son of one of the most renowned Dzogchen masters of this century, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, the current Tsoknyi Rinpoche was recognized at age eight by His Holiness Karmapa. At age thirteen he began twelve years of very intense formal training. \n\nMusic:  Time for Peace - One -Part 2 -   www.timeforpeace.bandcamp.com. \nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this Divine music for this channel.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
