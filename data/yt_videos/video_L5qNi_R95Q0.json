    "title": "\"The Upanishads\" - A Selection for Meditation and Contemplation - Advaita - Vedanta",
    "description": "This is a reading for meditation from 3 Upanishad texts - Isa, Kena, and Mandukya. Translated by Juan Mascaro.\n\nThe Upanishads are regarded as the \u201ccrown\u201d or the \u201ccream\u201d of the Vedas and are the Hindu scriptures which primarily discuss philosophy, meditation, and the nature of God; they form the core spiritual thought of Vedantic Hinduism. They are an unsystematized compilation of dialogs, monologues and anecdotes composed by multiple authors, which contain the foundations for most of the later philosophies and religions of India.\n\nThe Sanskrit term upani\u1e63ad literally means \"sitting down beside.\" The word derives from \u201cupa\u201d (near), \u201cni\u201d (down), and \u201csad\u201d (to sit), and refers to \"sitting down near\" a spiritual teacher (guru) in order to receive instruction in the Guru-shishya tradition.\n\nMusic: Macroform - Chakra\nDavid Schombert - Lagoon\nWah! - Sri Ram, Om Namah Shivaya, \nManeesh de Moor - Compassion \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
