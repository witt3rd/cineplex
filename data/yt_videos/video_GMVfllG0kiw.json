    "description": "Paramahansa Yogananda (January 5, 1893 \u2013 March 7, 1952) was an Indian monk, yogi and guru who introduced millions to the teachings of meditation and Kriya Yoga through his organization Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) / Yogoda Satsanga Society (YSS) of India, and who lived his last 32 years in America. \nA chief disciple of the Bengali yoga guru Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, he was sent by his lineage to spread the teachings of yoga to the West, to prove the unity between Eastern and Western religions and to preach a balance between Western material growth and Indian spirituality. His long-standing influence in the American yoga movement, and especially the yoga culture of Los Angeles, led him to be considered by yoga experts as the \"Father of Yoga in the West.\" Yogananda was the first major Indian teacher to settle in America.\n\nMusic: Time for Peace - Track 1 - Dawn\nTrack 2 -Evening Sea from album \"Yoga In Daily Life Relaxation Music\"\nWith thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for permission to use his beautiful music.
