    "description": "'Ab\u016b 'Abdull\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn 'Al\u012b ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn `Arab\u012b al-\u1e24\u0101tim\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6c\u0101\u02be\u012b  was a Sufi mystic, poet, and philosopher born in Murcia, Spain on the 17th of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n (26 July 1165 AD). He was one of the great mystics of all time. Through the richness of his personal experience and the constructive power of his intellect, he made a unique contribution to Shi'ite Sufism. He was considered a Saint.\nAfter his death, Ibn Arabi's teachings quickly spread throughout the Islamic world. His writings were not limited to the Muslim elites, but made their way into other ranks of society through the widespread reach of the Sufi orders. Arabi's work also popularly spread through works in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu.\n\nPainting/image by: Joumana Medlej\nMusic: Time for Peace - \"I am Here\" - (Meeting Silence) \nhttps://timeforpeace.bandcamp.com/\nWith deep gratitude to Swami Madhuram Puri for the offering of his beautiful music to use on my channel.\n_______________________________________________ \n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n_______________________________________________\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
