    "description": "Anandamayi Ma (n\u00e9e Nirmala Sundari; 30 April 1896 \u2013 27 August 1982) was a Bengali Saint, described by Sivananda Saraswati (of the Divine Life Society) as \"the most perfect flower the Indian soil has produced.\" Precognition, faith healing and miracles were attributed to her by her followers. Paramahansa Yogananda translates the Sanskrit epithet Anandamayi as \"Joy-permeated\" in English. This name was given to her by her devotees in the 1920s to describe her perpetual state of divine joy.\n\nMusic: Meditative Mind - Angelic Healing music 432Hz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MgQU23CJ-A\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
