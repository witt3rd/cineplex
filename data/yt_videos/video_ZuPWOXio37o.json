    "description": "This is a condensed version of The Tibetan Book of the Dead by Padmasambhava. It was written down by Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche\u2019s great grand-father, according to vision-teachings he directly received from Padmasambhava. Tulku Urgyen said that meditators would all benefit immensely from being familiar with these reminders.\nTranslated by Eric Pema Kunsang.
