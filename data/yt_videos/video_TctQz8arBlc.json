    "title": "Kahlil Gibran (2)  \"The Beauty of Death\"  - Mystical/Spiritual Poetry",
    "description": "Reading of one of Gibran's famous poems, \"The Beauty of Death.\" \nLebanon-born writer and artist Kahlil Gibran  (1883\u20131931) became known for his mystical Arabic and English works, most notably the 1923 publication, 'The Prophet.' Kahlil Gibran moved to the United States in 1895 and was exposed to Boston's artistic community. Initially showing promise as an artist, he also began writing newspaper columns and books in Arabic, drawing attention for his prose poems. After moving to New York City, Gibran began writing books in English. The popularity of The Prophet endured well after the author's death in 1931, making him the third-best-selling poet of all time.\n\nMusic:  Time for Peace - One -Part 2.\nThis beautiful music can be purchased and downloaded here:  www.timeforpeace.bandcamp.com. \nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this exquisite music for this channel.\n_________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
