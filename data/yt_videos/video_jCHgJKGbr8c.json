    "description": "Powerful, direct and clear instructions for developing awareness at the time of death and for recognising the stages of the bardo - as taught by the Omniscient Master, Longchen Rabjam. The text can be found here: https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/longchen-rabjam/complete-set-instructions\nTranslated by Adam Pearcey.\n\nLongchenpa ( \u2018Infinite, Vast Expanse of Space\u2019), or Drim\u00e9 \u00d6zer (1308-1364), was one of the most brilliant teachers of the Nyingma lineage. He systematized the Nyingma teachings in his \u2018Seven Treasures\u2019 and wrote extensively on Dzogchen. He transmitted the Longchen Nyingtik cycle of teachings and practice to Jikm\u00e9 Lingpa, and it has since become one of the most widely practiced of traditions.\n\nMusic: Mirada - \"Tranquility\"\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
