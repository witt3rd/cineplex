    "description": "This is a short selection of pith pointers taken from Milarepa's 100,000 songs. Translated by Garma C. Chang.\n\nMilarepa is one of the most important yogis and spiritual poets in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, but very little of his life is known with any historical certainty. Even the dates of his birth and death have been notoriously difficult to calculate. In any case, it is clear that he lived during the eleventh and early-twelfth centuries, at the advent of the latter dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet. \nAt his mother's request, Milarepa left home and studied sorcery to take revenge on their cruel relatives, killing many people. Later he felt sorrow about his deeds, and became student of Marpa the Translator.  Eventually, Marpa accepted him, explaining that the trials were a means to purify Milarepa's negative karma.\n\nMusic: Time for Peace -  Raag Ahir Bhairav - from the album \"Bridge\"\nWith thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for permission to use his beautiful music. More of his music can be found here: https://timeforpeace.bandcamp.com/\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
