    "title": "A Meditation Teaching on Emptiness - Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche - Dzogchen - Tibetan Buddhism",
    "description": "Profound pointers on emptiness for meditation taken from the text entitled: \"The Mirror of Essential Points\" - A letter in praise of Emptiness by Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche.\n\nNyoshul Khen Rinpoche (1932-1999) was a revered Tibetan meditation master, scholar, and poet, whose extraordinary presence and brilliant teaching style made a deep impact on the current generation of Tibetan lamas and on the transmission of Tibetan Buddhism to the West. A principal lineage holder in the Rime (nonsectarian) movement of Tibetan Buddhism, Nyoshul Khenpo counted twenty-five teachers from all of the Tibetan lineages as his masters. Foremost, he was an authority on the teachings of the Nyingma master Longchenpa and the Longchen Nyingthig, a cycle of teachings that focus on revealing the mind\u2019s fundamental nature of luminous purity. \n\nText taken from \"Quintessential Dzogchen\" - edited by Erik Pema Kunsang and Marcia Binder Schmidt.\n\nMusic by: Ethereal Ephemera - Escape to Dreamscape\nWings Of An Angel - Farewell Darshan From The Madness Of Rationality And Materialism -  The Spiritual Origins Of Mind-Expanding Throat Singing\nC.paradisi - Sketches From The Edge Of Silence V.2 - 01 Winds Cease\nPlease find all these musicians and their creations at: www.bandcamp.com\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
