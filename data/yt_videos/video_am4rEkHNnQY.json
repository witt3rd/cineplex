    "description": "Shakya Shri J\u00f1ana, 'The Vital Essence' in Quintessential Dzogchen, translated & compiled by Erik Pema Kunsang and Marcia Binder Schmidt.\n\nTokden Shakya Shri  (1853-1919) \u2014 was a great Mahamudra and Dzogchen master. He was brought up in a Drukpa Kagy\u00fc monastery, and his main masters from that tradition were Khamtrul Tenp\u00e9 Nyima and Drubwang Tsoknyi. He later met Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo from whom he received Dzogchen teachings. He established a meditation camp in Khyipuk, Central Tibet, which gathered up to 700 students in simple tents and hillside caves, and was famous for its strict discipline and zealous practice of Mahamudra and Dzogchen meditation. His students included Lama S\u00f6nam Zangpo, the grandfather of Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche.\n\nMusic credits: Meditative Mind - Music to balance Male and Female Energy' by Meditative Mind.
