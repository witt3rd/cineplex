    "description": "Anandamayi Ma (n\u00e9e Nirmala Sundari; 30 April 1896 \u2013 27 August 1982) was a Bengali Saint, described by Sivananda Saraswati (of the Divine Life Society) as \"the most perfect flower the Indian soil has produced.\" Precognition, faith healing and miracles were attributed to her by her followers. Paramahansa Yogananda translates the Sanskrit epithet Anandamayi - as \"Joy-permeated\" in English. This name was given to her by her devotees in the 1920s to describe her perpetual state of divine joy.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
