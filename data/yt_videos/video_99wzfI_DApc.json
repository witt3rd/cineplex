    "description": "Garab Dorje (Fl. 55 CE) Prahevajra (Pramodavajra/Surativajra) was the semi-historical first human teacher of the Ati Yoga (Dzogchen) or Great Perfection teachings according to Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\n\nBorn 166 years after the Parinirvana of Lord Buddha in Oddiyana northwest of India, Garab Dorje, an incarnation of Vajrasattva, was the first human teacher of the Atiyoga Tantras. From the age of seven, he defeated the pandits of Oddiyana and India with his teaching that Dzogchen goes beyond the law of Karma, the law of cause and effect. At his passing into the Body of Light, he gave his Disciple Manjushrimitra what have become known as the Three Statements or Three Testaments.\n\nText read from the book - The Golden Letters -  translated by John Reynolds\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
