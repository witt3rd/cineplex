    "title": "Joel Goldsmith - Selected excerpts from \"The Infinite Way\" -  Christian Mystics",
    "description": "Joel Solomon Goldsmith (March 10, 1892 \u2013 June 17, 1964) was an American spiritual author, teacher, spiritual healer, and modern-day mystic. He founded The Infinite Way movement. He was born in New York City on March 10, 1892.  His parents were non-practicing Jews, who were married in New York City in 1891. \n\nIn 1915, Joel's father became critically ill while in England and word was sent to the Goldsmith family to come for the body. However, according to Joel, his father was healed by a Christian Science practitioner in London. From his early adulthood, Joel Goldsmith had many spiritual experiences. Joel was a healer who spent many years in spiritual studies, reading original scriptures of Aramaic, Greek and Sanskrit origins. His first book, The Infinite Way, was published in 1948.\n\nMusic: Connecting Body, Mind and Soul - Body Mind Zone\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
