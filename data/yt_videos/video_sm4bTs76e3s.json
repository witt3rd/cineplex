    "title": "Sant (Saint) Tukaram - Selected Poems for Meditation - Bhakti",
    "description": "Tukaram, also known as Sant Tukaram, was as an Indian poet and saint in the 17th century. He was one of the saints of the Bhakti movement in Maharashtra who composed the devotional poetry, Abhanga. His kirtans aka spiritual songs were devoted to Vithoba or Vitthala, an avatar of Hindu god Vishnu. He was born in the village of Dehu in Maharashtra. As a young man, he lost both his parents. The tragedies in his personal life continued as his first wife and son also died. Although Tukaram married for the second time, he didn\u2019t find solace in worldly pleasures for long and eventually renounced everything. He spent his later years in devotional worship, and composing kirtans and poetry.  \n\nArt image:  theyashnaiduart\nMusic: Good Night - Yoga In Daily Life Relaxation Music - Swami Madhuram\n www.timeforpeace.bandcamp.com. \nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this Divine music for this channel.\nFlute Music produced by Eduard Ritok\n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
