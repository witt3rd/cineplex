    "description": "Remarkable teachings intended for meditation and for cutting through delusions!\nThe Words of Old Tcheng first appeared in the French journal, Etre, in 1974. \nWhere this text first originated and at what time are unknown. It was given by a Buddhist monk in the form of a written document to a Frenchman who was visiting Indochina.\nIndications of style suggest that it may belong to the school of Zen founded by Hui Neng, the 6th Zen patriarch.\n\nFrench paraphrase of the original Buddhist text by J. Garillot (1974), translated by Else van den Muyzenberg.\n\nPlease note: all of my recordings can be downloaded via my Google Drive under the COMMUNITY tab of my YT main page.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
