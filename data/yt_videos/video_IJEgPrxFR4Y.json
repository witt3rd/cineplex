    "description": "Hakuin Ekaku  (January 19, 1686 \u2013 January 18, 1769)  is undeniably one of the most important of all Zen masters.   He came into the Rinzai school of Zen and revitalized it during a period when its very survival was in question, focusing practice back on the basics of zazen and koan study.  He was the quintessential Zen master of the people, who extended his teaching far beyond the monastery to include folks from all walks of life.  All modern Rinzai masters trace their lineage back through Hakuin.\nHakuin was born in the small village of Hara, at the foot of Mount Fuji, Japan. His mother was a devout Nichiren Buddhist, and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist monk.\n\nThe text of the poems read can be found here: https://www.poetrychaikhana.com/Poets/H/Hakuin/index.html\n\nMusic: Adrian Freeman - Shakuhachi  & Handpan \nhttps://adrianfreedman.bandcamp.com/ \n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Sincere gratitude to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of appreciation for these recordings.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
