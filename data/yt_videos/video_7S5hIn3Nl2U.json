    "title": "\"On Cleaving to God\"  - Saint Albert the Great - Christian Philosophy",
    "description": "Excerpts read from the classic text, On Cleaving to God. This text is an enduring Christina Classic. Albertus Magnus better known as St. Albert the Great wrote it almost 800 years ago. In it he describes the love of god that will help the faithful cleave to him. \n\nAlbertus Magnus (c. 1200 \u2013 November 15, 1280), also known as Saint Albert the Great or Albert of Cologne, was a German Catholic Dominican friar, philosopher and bishop. Later canonised as a Catholic saint, he was known during his lifetime as Doctor universalis and Doctor expertus and, late in his life, the sobriquet Magnus was appended to his name. Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. S\u00f6der have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the Middle Ages. The Catholic Church distinguishes him as one of the 36 Doctors of the Church.\n\nArt/image by Dmitri Matkovsky  - \"Art is collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better.\"\nhttps://www.saatchiart.com/art/Painting-Art-is-collaboration-between-God-Abstract-Original-ART/824166/3149871/view\n\nMusic: Daniel Taddeo - with thanks for Daniel for gifting his original, beautiful music on Track 1\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
