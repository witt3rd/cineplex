    "description": "Remarkable teachings intended for meditation and for cutting through delusions!\nThe Words of Old Tcheng first appeared in the French journal, Etre, in 1974. \nWhere this text first originated and at what time are unknown. It was given by a Buddhist monk in the form of a written document to a Frenchman who was visiting Indochina.\nIndications of style suggest that it may belong to the school of Zen founded by Hui Neng, the 6th Zen patriarch.\n\nFrench paraphrase of the original Buddhist text by J. Garillot (1974), translated by Else van den Muyzenberg.\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
