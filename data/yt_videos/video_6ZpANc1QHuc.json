    "description": "The Tao Te Ching was written in China roughly 2,500 years ago at about the same time when Buddha expounded the Dharma in India and Pythagoras taught in Greece. The Tao Te Ching, traditionally credited to the 6th-century BC sage Lao Tzu, is probably the most influential Chinese book of all times. Its 81 chapters have been translated into English more times than any other Chinese document. \nTranslation by Feng, Gia-Fu & Jane English.\n\nMusic by Calm Whale\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
