    "description": "The Diamond S\u016btra (Sanskrit: Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra) is a Mah\u0101y\u0101na (Buddhist) s\u016btra from the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras or 'Perfection of Wisdom' genre. Translated into a variety of languages over a broad geographic range, the Diamond S\u016btra is one of the most influential Mahayana sutras in East Asia, and it is particularly prominent within the Chan (or Zen) tradition, along with the Heart Sutra. The work, which offers meditations on illusion and perception, was originally written in Sanskrit and first translated into Chinese in 402 A.D.\n\nThe Diamond Sutra is one of the most historically important texts in the Buddhist faith, in part because a copy of it is the oldest surviving dated printed book in the world (868 A.D.).  The Diamond Sutra posits that something is what it is only because of what it is not.\n\nThis reading is from the translation from Red Pine (Bill Porter).\nThe Diamond Sutra contains answers to all questions of delusion and dualism. This is the Buddhist teaching on the perfection of wisdom and cuts through all obstacles on the path of practice.\n______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
