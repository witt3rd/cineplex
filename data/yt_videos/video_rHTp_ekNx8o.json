    "description": "Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol  (1781-1851) was a Tibetan Buddhist yogi and poet from Amdo. Shabkar's yogic and poetic skill is considered second only to Milarepa.\n\nShabkar begin his spiritual practice early, completing a one-year retreat at the age of 16, later becoming a Gelug monk at 20. Shabkar studied with masters of all major Tibetan Buddhist schools including Gelug and Nyingma, and received Dzogchen teachings from his main root guru Ch\u00f6gyal Ngakgi Wangpo. He spent years in solitary retreats in various caves, woods and mountains of Tibet.  Shabkar's works express non-sectarian ideals similar to those of the 19th century Rim\u00e9 movement, even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rime masters from Kham.\nTeaching called \"Songs of Examining\" taken from the book - 'Quintessential Dzogchen: Confusion Dawns as Wisdom' - translated by Erik Pema Kunsang and Marcia Binder Schmidt.\nBook can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.com.au/Quintessential-Dzogchen-Confusion-Dawns-Wisdom/dp/9627341584\n\nPainting by Dugu Tulku Choegyal Rinpoche\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
