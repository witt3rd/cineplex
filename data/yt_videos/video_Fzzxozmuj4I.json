    "description": "Google's quantum computer has been used to create a time crystal, a newly defined phase of matter that defies the laws of scientific physics.\n\u00bb Recap on Quantum Supremacy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyuf1zt-TpU \n\u00bb Subscribe to Seeker! http://bit.ly/subscribeseeker \n\u00bb Watch more Elements! http://bit.ly/ElementsPlaylist\n\u00bb Visit our shop at http://shop.seeker.com\n\nGoogle has been tinkering with one they\u2019ve dubbed Sycamore and its biggest success to date was massively outperforming a conventional supercomputer, albeit in one task that was tailor-made to play to its strengths. Now, though, Google along with collaborating researchers have announced that they\u2019ve used their quantum computer to create a newly defined phase of matter: a time crystal.\n\nYes you heard that right, according to a preprint paper by Google the company stated they\u2019ve used their quantum computer to create time crystals. But before you go thinking I\u2019m talking about some mystical sci-fi gemstone that allows its wielder to bend time to their whim, I should clarify what a time crystal is exactly. Ordinary crystals like diamonds have their atoms arranged in repeating patterns in space. In 2012, physicist and Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek wondered if an object could exist with a crystal-like pattern but instead of that pattern repeating  physically, it repeated through time. Wilczek wondered if an object could change and then revert back to its original state, flipping back and forth in regular intervals indefinitely with no energy input. A phase of matter locked in a self-sustained cycle of change. It\u2019s a cool idea but there\u2019s a problem: a Wilczekian time crystal basically achieves perpetual motion and that is a fundamental no-no.\n\nWilczek wondered if an object could change and then revert back to its original state, flipping back and forth in regular intervals indefinitely with no energy input. A phase of matter locked in a self-sustained cycle of change. It\u2019s a cool idea but there\u2019s a problem: a Wilczekian time crystal basically achieves perpetual motion and that is a fundamental no-no. A 2014 proof showed that this iteration of a time crystal was impossible. But physicists couldn\u2019t be deterred and so they expanded the definition of what a time crystal could be. A so-called Floquet time crystal would flip back and forth like a Wilczekian one, but only if it\u2019s being driven by an external source. Physicists have simulated Floquet time crystals in computers, imagining a row of particles with spins that flip up and down periodically when hit with a laser beam. This time crystal needs the laser\u2019s cycling light waves to flip, but it wouldn\u2019t absorb any net energy from the laser to do so. \n\n#google #googlecrystal #quantumphysics #physics #science #seeker #space #technology #elements\n\nRead More: \n\nEternal Change for No Energy: A Time Crystal Finally Made Real\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/first-time-crystal-built-using-googles-quantum-computer-20210730/ \n\"Like a perpetual motion machine, a time crystal forever cycles between states without consuming energy. Physicists claim to have built this new phase of matter inside a quantum computer.\"\n\nWhat the heck is a time crystal, and why are physicists obsessed with them?\nhttps://www.popsci.com/science/what-is-time-crystal-physics/ \n\"In the last few years, physicists around the world have been constructing another state of matter: a \u201ctime crystal.\u201d If that seems like B-movie technobabble, it\u2019s technobabble no longer. Using a quantum computer, a few researchers have created a time crystal that, they think, firmly establishes time crystals in the world of physics.\"\n\nWorld\u2019s first time crystals cooked up using new recipe\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/2119804-worlds-first-time-crystals-cooked-up-using-new-recipe/ \n\"Using Yao\u2019s recipe as guidance, two groups have now created time crystals in the lab. Last September, a group headed by Chris Monroe of the University of Maryland in College Park built a time crystal out of a string of trapped ytterbium ions.\"\n____________________\n\nElements is more than just a science show.
