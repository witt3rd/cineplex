    "title": "A Guided Meditation on Boundlessness - Based on Selected Verses and Poems of  Ilie Cioara (3)",
    "description": "These poems/stanzas written by Ilie Cioara have been formatted for the purpose of a guided meditation. Excerpts taken from the book by Cioara, \"The Silence of the Mind\" - translated by Petrica Verdes.\n\nIlie Cioara (1916 - 2004) was an enlightened mystic who did not belong to any lineage. He is unique in a way, in the sense that he lived in almost complete isolation, in Romania, Eastern Europe in a communist country, completely oblivious of nonduality, Zen, etc. Originally a Christian mystic, he practiced a mantra for over 20 years. One day, he felt an intuitive impulse to drop the mantra, and just practice the silence of the mind, by listening to the noises on the street, in the now. After following this practice for a few years, one morning, as he was waking up from his sleep, he realised the veils had completely dropped. His description of meditation is fresh and devoid of any tradition and jargon.\n\nThe book can be purchased here or on Amazon: https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-silence-of-the-mind-ilie-cioara/ebook/9781846948305.html\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A sincere thank you to all listeners and donors for your appreciative comments and offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
