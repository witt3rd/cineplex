    "description": "He\u021f\u00e1ka S\u00e1pa, commonly known as Black Elk (December 1, 1863 \u2013 August 19, 1950), was a wi\u010dh\u00e1\u0161a wak\u021f\u00e1\u014b (\"medicine man, holy man\") and heyoka of the Oglala Lakota people. He was a second cousin of the war leader Crazy Horse. \n\nWhen Black Elk was nine years old, he was suddenly taken ill; he lay prone and unresponsive for several days. During this time he had a great vision in which he was visited by the Thunder Beings (Wakinyan). He said: \"Spirits were represented as kind and loving, full of years and wisdom, like revered human grandfathers.\"  When he was seventeen, Black Elk told a medicine man, Black Road, about the vision in detail. Black Road and the other medicine men of the village were \"astonished by the greatness of the vision.\"\n\nBlack Elk had learned many things in his vision to help heal his people. He had come from a long line of medicine men and healers in his family; his father was a medicine man, as were his paternal uncles.\n\nMusic: Shamanic Gateway - John Dumas\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
