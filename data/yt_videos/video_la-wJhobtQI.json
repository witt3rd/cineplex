    "description": "Readings from selected chapters from the text \"Seeds of Contemplation\" by Thomas Merton. New Seeds of Contemplation is one of Thomas Merton's most widely read and best-loved books. Christians and non-Christians alike have joined in praising it as a notable successor in the meditative tradition of St. John of the Cross, The Cloud of Unknowing, and the medieval mystics, while others have compared Merton's reflections with those of Thoreau. \n\nMusic credits: \"Joy\" by Indiajiva\n\"Lagoon\" - David Schombert\n\"Deep Peace\" - Bill Douglas\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
