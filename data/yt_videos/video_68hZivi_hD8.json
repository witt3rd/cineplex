    "description": "Sand\u014dkai - written in the 8th century by  Chinese Zen ancestor Sekito Kisen, a disciple of the sixth patriarch, Eno, it is one of the most important texts in the Soto Zen school . \nSan: many, difference, form. Do: unity, identity, ku (emptiness); kai: meeting.\nSeveral translations are possible: identity of the many and the one; meeting of identity and difference; uniqueness of reality and emptiness, etc.\nThe Sandokai deals with the realization of the fundamental unity at the heart of contradictions and of the duality created by our brain.\nTranslated by Masunaga Reih\u014d \nSome notes on the  text can be found here: https://www.existentialbuddhist.com/tag/sandokai/\n\nCalligraphy by Taisen Deshimaru Roshi (1914-1982)\nMusic: Grace of Silence - Yatao Handpan duo\n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
