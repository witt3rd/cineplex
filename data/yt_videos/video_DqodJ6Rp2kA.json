    "description": "Please note: these teachings are only suitable for those with a very good understanding, grasp, and deep respect for the perfection of the Master's teachings. Intended for deep meditation and contemplation.\n\nDzogchen, or the \"Great Perfection,\" is considered by many to be the apex of Tibetan Buddhism, and Longchen Rabjam is the most celebrated of all the saints of this remarkable tradition. Natural Perfection presents the radical precepts of Dzogchen, pointing the way to absolute liberation from conceptual fetters and leading the practitioner to a state of pure, natural integration into one's true being.\n\nReading taken by the text translated by  Keith Dowman.
