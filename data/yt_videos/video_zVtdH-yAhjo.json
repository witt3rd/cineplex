    "description": "Ry\u014dkan Taigu (1758\u20131831) was a quiet and unconventional S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhist monk who lived much of his life as a hermit. Ry\u014dkan is remembered for his poetry and calligraphy, which present the essence of Zen life. He renounced the world at an early age to train at nearby S\u014dt\u014d Zen temple K\u014dsh\u014d-ji, refusing to meet with or accept charity from his family.\n\nMusic:  Deuter - \"Illumination\"\nNorihita Suda - \"A Swallow in Winter\"\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
