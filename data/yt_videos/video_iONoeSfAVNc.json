    "description": "This guided meditation has been formatted from a teaching where H.H. gave a clear exposition on meditation practice in London, 1979. You can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbJ7u_nJb54\n\nHis Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche (1904-1987) was one of the greatest scholars and tantric masters of Tibetan Buddhism. The direct reincarnation of Padmasambhava himself, his life was foretold in the predictions of the great tantric master when he arrived in Tibet in the eighth century. He said that he would be reborn in our time as Dudjom Rinpoche, giving details of date, place and specific signs.\nConsidered the greatest terton (discoverer of hidden texts, or terma) of our time, His Holiness has also made a thorough and critical study of all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, realizing the wisdom of all lineages.\n\nMusic:   \"Still Return\" - Harold Budd\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
