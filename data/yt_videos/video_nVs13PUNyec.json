    "title": "Mirabai (Meera) - Selected Poems for Meditation - Hindu Mystic - Poet Bhakti Movement",
    "description": "Mirabai (1502\u20131556) was a 16th-century Hindu mystic poet and devotee of Krishna. She is a celebrated Bhakti saint, particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition.\nMirabai was  known for the incomparable beauty of the poems and bhajans she composed and sang in devotion to her beloved god, Krishna. Born in Rajasthan, she was married against her will to a prince of Chittor, near the fabled city of Udaipur. Her life was marred by persecution as she struggled to manifest her ardent desire to compose, sing and pursue spiritual studies. Though she was renowned for her talent, her family felt she was bringing dishonour by not behaving the way a courtly lady should \u2014 and they tried to poison and drown her.\n\nPoems taken from this website: https://www.poemhunter.com/mirabai/poems/\n\nArt image - \"Night's Dream\" by Dan Hillier used with kind permission of the artist.\nPlease see Dan's incredible art at: https://danhillier.com/\n\nMusic - Original music created by Jayasara using sample Indic sounds and doing weird things with programming!\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
