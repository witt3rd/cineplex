    "description": "Excerpts from the text \"The Golden Letters\" translated by John Myrdhin Reynolds.\n\nThe lineage of Dzogchen, unbroken to the present day, is traced from the dharmakaya Samantabhadra (\u2018Kuntuzangpo\u2019 in Tibetan) to the sambhogakaya, represented by the five buddha families and Vajrasattva, and then to the first human master Garab Dorje. It then passed to Ma\u00f1jushrimitra. At the time of his parinirvana, Garab Dorje ascended into the sky and dissolved into rainbow light. At this, Ma\u00f1jushrimitra cried out in despair and distress, and made a very beautiful plea: \u201cWhat will become of us now that you are passing away? You are the light of the world\u2026\u201d\n\nWhereupon Garab Dorje was moved, and his hand reappeared, in which was a small golden casket, the size of a thumbnail, containing the teaching of Hitting the Essence in Three Words, which he let fall into the hand of Ma\u00f1jushrimitra. As soon as he received it, his mind became the same as the wisdom mind of his master Garab Dorje.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
