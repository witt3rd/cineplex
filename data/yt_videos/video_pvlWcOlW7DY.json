    "description": "Excerpts taken from the text \"All Else is Bondage\" by Wei Wu Wei.\nTerence James Stannus Gray (14 September 1895 \u2013 5 January 1986), better known by the pen name Wei Wu Wei, was a 20th-century Taoist philosopher and writer.\n\nBetween the years 1958 and 1974 a series of eight books appeared attributed to the mysterious 'Wei Wu Wei'.  These works draw on a variety of sources, including Taoism, specifically the texts attributed to Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, Buddhism, especially The Heart, Diamond and Lankavatara Sutras, and Chan Buddhism as taught by Hui Neng, Huang Po, Hui Hai, etc., as well as the teachings of Padma Sambhava and Sri Ramana Maharshi, among others. \n\nMusic credits: Brian Eno - \"Thursday Space Music\"\n\nPlease note; my recordings can be downloaded via my Google Drive site - details of which can be found under the COMMUNITY tab of my YT page.\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
