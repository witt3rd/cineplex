    "description": "Selected excerpts from the teaching given by Namkai Norbu entitled: The Mirror: Advice on Presence and Awareness. The full teaching can be found here: https://realization.org/p/namkhai-norbu/mirror.html\n\nCh\u00f6gyal Namkhai Norbu (1938-2018) was a Tibetan Dzogchen master. When he was two years old, Namkhai Norbu was recognized as the 'mindstream emanation', a tulku, of the Dzogchen teacher Adzom Drugpa (1842\u20131924). At five, he was also recognized as a mindstream emanation of an emanation of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594\u20131651). From an early age, Namkhai Norbu undertook an accelerated course of study, attending monastic college, taking retreats, and studying with renowned teachers, including some of the most important Tibetan masters of his time.\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
