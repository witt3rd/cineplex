    "description": "Happy Christmas dear Dharma friends. May there be peace on earth and in the heart of all beings. \ud83d\udc97\ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\ude3b\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi (1182 \u2013 3 October 1226) was an Italian Catholic friar, deacon, mystic, and preacher. He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the women's Order of Saint Clare, the Third Order of Saint Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land. Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in Christianity.\n\nPope Gregory IX canonized Francis on 16 July 1228. Along with Saint Catherine of Siena, he was designated patron saint of Italy. He later became associated with patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became customary for churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on or near his feast day of 4 October.\n\nMusic: Dan Gibson - Pange, Lingua Gloriosi (Album - \"Solitudes\")\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3H5f7oePQE&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=PetrusJosephus\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
