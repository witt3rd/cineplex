I got the idea from an Instagram product that can send an emergency SMS with GPS location to a phone. But the only problem was that the instagram product requires a smartphone to do this which I think is not ideal. So I came up with a box that can do all this work on its own without requiring a smartphone. And as a bonus; my box can also call you to get you out of awkward conversations ;-) Let's get started!\n\nWebsites which were shown/used in the video:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/invisawear/\nhttps://www.invisawear.com/collections/necklaces/products/silver-leather-choker\nhttps://www.invisawear.com/pages/faqs\nhttps://www.elecrow.com/download/A6%20module%20AT%20commands.pdf\nhttps://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mp1584.html\nhttps://lastminuteengineers.com/a6-gsm-gprs-module-arduino-tutorial/\nhttps://lastminuteengineers.com/neo6m-gps-arduino-tutorial/\nhttps://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus\n\nThanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video.\n\n0:00 Instagram product that I want to improve\n1:32 Intro\n2:30 Hardware overview\n5:07 Building the test circuit\n5:52 Using the GPS/GSM board\n8:02 Final code & prototype test\n8:52 Building the final \"product\"",
