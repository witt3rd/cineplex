    "description": "*** Today's Sudoku***\n\nSimon has been to a Christmas lunch and we apologise in advance for whatever unclevernesses he manages to depict during his solve.  The puzzle he's facing is W Pentominoes by Sam Cappleman-Lynes - and it's a \"normal\" killer sudoku.  Except, as always with Sam, this one is infused with genius.  A sober Simon would have struggled!  Play the puzzle at the link below: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/7BtmQgjnd6\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply.  In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage.  Digits cannot repeat within a cage.\n\n** Join The Best Sudoku Club On Earth **\nYou can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month here:  \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\nLoads of extra puzzles and videos are available here.
