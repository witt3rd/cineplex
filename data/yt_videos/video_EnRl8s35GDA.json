We're Simon Anthony and Mark Goodliffe, two of the UK's most enthusiastic puzzle solvers. We have both represented the UK at the World Sudoku Championships and the World Puzzle Championships. \n\nThank you for watching!\nSimon and Mark\n\nWe have been going now for over 2,000 videos and this is the first time (to our knowledge) that we have finished a puzzle incorrectly.  Apologies to the_cogito and to our viewers.  At the very end of this video Simon, who is somewhat traumatised by this point as you can see, spies a 4 in r9c4 and thinks \"negative constraint\" as a way of disambiguating the final pattern.  Of course he overlooks the fact that the 4 would be clueing 1s in the row, not 9s!!  There is a 6 in r9c9 that sorts it all out.  Simon has been sent back to sudoku school to learn the differences between digits!",
