    "description": "Selected pointers from Jean Klein along with excerpts taken from the text \"I Am\".\n\nJean Klein (October 19, 1912 \u2013 February 22, 1998) was a French author, spiritual teacher and philosopher of Advaita Vedanta (Nondualism). He was born in Berlin and spent his childhood in Brno and Prague. Having left Germany in 1933 for France, he secretly worked with the French Resistance in the Second World War. Klein was a musicologist and doctor, traveled to India where he was influenced by Sri Atmananda Krishna Menon, studied Kashmir Shaivism and was sent to the West to teach Advaita Vedanta. He is regarded as one most eloquent communicators of non-duality in the second half of the 20th century. \n\nPhoto/image: Justin Bateman - used with kind permission\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
