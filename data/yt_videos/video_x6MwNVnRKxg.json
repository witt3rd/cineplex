    "title": "'The Song Celestial' - Verses from the  Bhagavad Gita - Ramana Maharshi - Advaita-Vedanta",
    "description": "\"The Song Celestial\" embodies forty-two slokas selected by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi from Srimad Bhagavad Gita at the request of his devotees. Bhagavan has given the verses a very logical sequence, a coherent flow and synopsis in Krishna\u2019s own words. The beauty of this selection is that it incorporates in a mere 42 verses the entire message of the Lord\u2019s song of 700 verses. As the title suggests, these verses are the quintessence of the Gita.\n\nSuch a very concise selection from this spiritual masterpiece of all times has not, to our knowledge, been ever made by any commentator on the Gita in any language. The verses comprised in the booklet include the verses from the Gita which Bhagavan quoted in the course of his answers to the question of visitors and devotees. It is as if Bhagavan Krishna Himself came as Bhagavan Ramana to give his loving, eternal message in a nutshell to humans.\nThe reading is taken from this website/source: https://www.inner-quest.org/Song_Celestial.htm\n\nMusic: Rooted in Stillness - Egemen Sanli\n\"The Heart is Awake\" - Echo - with deep thanks to Billy for permission to use his beautiful music.\nFor more of Billy's music and to purchase/download please see:  https://theheartisawake.bandcamp.com\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
