    "description": "Excerpts taken from the text \"All Else is Bondage\" by Wei Wu Wei.\nTerence James Stannus Gray (14 September 1895 \u2013 5 January 1986), better known by the pen name Wei Wu Wei, was a 20th-century Taoist philosopher and writer.\n\nBetween the years 1958 and 1974 a series of eight books appeared attributed to the mysterious 'Wei Wu Wei'. In addition to these texts there were pieces contributed to various periodicals during the 1960's, including 'The Mountain Path', a periodical dedicated to the teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, 'The Middle Way', the U.K. Buddhist Society's journal, and 'Etre Libre', a French-language periodical published in Brussels. These works draw on a variety of sources, including Taoism, specifically the texts attributed to Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, Buddhism, especially The Heart, Diamond and Lankavatara Sutras, and Chan Buddhism as taught by Hui Neng, Huang Po, Hui Hai, etc., as well as the teachings of Padma Sambhava and Sri Ramana Maharshi, among others. \n\nMusic credits: Brian Eno - \"Thursday Afternoon Space Music\"\n\nPlease note; my recordings can be downloaded via my Google Drive site - details of which can be found under the COMMUNITY tab of my YT page.",
