    "description": "Lal Ded (1320\u20131392), known as Laleshwari in other parts of the subcontinent, was a Kashmiri mystic of the Kashmir Shaivism school of philosophy.  She was the creator of the style of mystic poetry called vatsun or Vakhs, literally \"speech\" (Voice). Known as Lal Vakhs, her verses are the earliest compositions in the Kashmiri language and are an important part in the history of modern Kashmiri literature. She inspired and interacted with many Sufis of Kashmir.\n\nMusic: Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard - \"Sorrow\"\nSiretzi Yares Daran (They Have Taken the One I Love) - L\u00c3\u00a9von Minassian \n\nPainting/image by Pariplab Chakraborty\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
