    "description": "His Holiness, the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (August 14, 1924 \u2013 November 5, 1981) was the spiritual leader of the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism and part of the oldest line of reincarnate lamas in Vajrayana Buddhism known as the Karmapas whose coming was predicted by the Buddha in the Samadhiraja Sutra.  The 16th Karmapa was considered to be a \"living Buddha\" and was deeply involved in the transmission of the Vajrayana Buddhism to Europe and North America following the Chinese invasion of Tibet. He had many monikers, including \u201cKing of the Yogis\u201d.\nThe full text of this reading can be found here: https://16th-karmapas-life.weebly.com/spontaneous-vajrasong-at-the-ground-breaking-ceremony-of-the-shri-nalanda-shedra-in-rumtek.html\n\nMusic:  Time for Peace - One -Part 2 -   www.timeforpeace.bandcamp.com. \nWith deepest thanks to Swami Madhuram Puri for his kind offering of this exquisite music for this channel.\n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
