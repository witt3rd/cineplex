We are also implementing the new PBS - Product Breakdown System for the Whole MMX. Chris, the new project manager has introduced me to the sacred lands of Excel heaven and although there is a lot of initial work we have to do to make this function properly, the long term efficiency will improve a lot! We are taking the MMX from being a one off DIY maker project to being a scalable, fully fledged - ready to build for any competent group of people - machine. Its really great! \n\nEnjoy and have a great day! \n\nMartin\n#wintergatan #marble #machine\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nIf you want to SUPPORT US:\nThe fact that you are watching the videos and care about the music and future of Wintergatan is the best support anyone can have, I want to thank everyone who is here for that kind of support, it is really the fuel for the Wintergatan Engine.\n\nIf you apart from that further want to support the projects, we have these different options set up:\n\nYOUTUBE MEMBERSHIP\n\u25baSupport by Joining the Wintergatan Youtube Channel by clicking the blue JOIN button next to subscribe or go here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/wintergatan2000\n\nAs a Member you'll have a Wintergatan badge next to your comment, long term members receive guest list tickets and early access to ticket sales for the upcoming world tour.\n\nPATREON\n\u25bahttp://www.patreon.com/wintergatan\n\n\nPAYPAL ME\n\u25bahttp://www.paypal.me/wintergatan\n\nWhy do we accept support in this way?\nI, Martin, can already sustain myself 100% doing what I love to do. If you want to support artists/organisations who have not yet reached that privileged position, please consider supporting other artists/organisations who need the support more. With that said, I have too many ideas and too little time and with your support I can get more help from people around me to execute the ideas better and bring them out in the world faster.
