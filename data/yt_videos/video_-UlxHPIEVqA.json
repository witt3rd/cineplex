    "description": "An excellent summary of the field of quantum computing. Find out more about Qiskit at https://qiskit.org and their YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/qiskit\nAnd get the poster here: https://store.dftba.com/collections/domain-of-science/products/map-of-quantum-computing\n\nWith this video I aim to give a really good overview of the field of quantum computing with a clear explanation of how they work, why people are excited about quantum algorithms and their value, the potential applications of quantum computers including quantum simulation, artificial intelligence and more, and the different models and physical implementations people are using to build quantum computers like superconducting devices, quantum dots, trapped ions, photons or neutral atoms, and the challenges they face.\n\n#quantumcomputer #quantum #domainofscience\n\n--- Get My Posters Here ----\nDFTBA Store: https://store.dftba.com/collections/domain-of-science \nRedBubble Store: https://www.redbubble.com/people/DominicWalliman\n\nI have also made posters available for personal or educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/\n\n-- Some Awesome People --- \nAnd many thanks to my $10 supporters and above on Patreon, you are awesome!\nJoin the gang and help support me produce free and high quality science content:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/domainofscience\n\nBob Milano\nRaj Duphare\nBen\nAnca Selariu\nEric Epstein\nGordon D Collins\nKamil Qbitskey\nMirik Gogri\nnoggieB\nPetr Murmak \nPrabhakar R\nReggie Fourmyle\nSandy Toye\nSebastian \nTerrence Masson \nTheodore Chu\nJoshua Rau\u00df\n\n--- Special thanks ---\nSpecial thanks for giving their time to help me with the script to:\nNicholas Bronn\nSergio Boixo\nStephanie Simmons\n\n--- My Science Books ----\nI also write science books for kids called Professor Astro Cat.
