    "description": "Julian of Norwich (1342-c 1416) was the most important English mystic of the 14th century. She wrote the best known surviving book in the English language written by a mystic, Revelations of Divine Love. The book is the first written in English by a woman.  Her spirituality is strongly Trinitarian and basically Neoplatonic. Through the Passion, Julian was led to  visions of the Trinity and of the universe as it exists in God.\n\nMusic: \"Finding Stillness\"  - Chris Collins\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
