    "description": "Chapter 4 - Knowledge and Ignorance\n\nJnaneshvar (1271-1296 CE) was a revolutionary, a pioneer in the expression of mystical truths in the Marathi language. Prior to him, all such literature had been framed in the classical Sanskrit; and Marathi, the popular language of Maharashtra, had been regarded as unfit for the transmission of sacred knowledge. Jnaneshvar changed all that. And today, the people of Maharashtra honor Jnaneshvar as their greatest poet-saint; millions visit his tomb at Alandi each year, and his songs are still sung daily in temples throughout the land.\n\nMusic credits: Stellardrone and j09n\nwww.bandcamp.com\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
