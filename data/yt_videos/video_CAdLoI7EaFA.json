    "title": "The Spandakarika -  \"Song of the Sacred Tremor\" - Kashmir Shaivism",
    "description": "The Spandakarika, or \"Song of the Sacred Tremor,\" is one of the most important Tantric texts in the tradition of Kashmiri Shaivism.  It is said to have been transmitted directly to the sage Vasugupta from the hands of Shiva on Mount Kailas. In his commentary on these fifty-two stanzas, the sage Ksemaraja described them as the heart of the Mahamudra, the Great Cosmic Gesture. \nTranslated by Daniel Odier \n\nMusic: Relaxing Sanskrit AUM by Gaiea\nAll Gaiea Sanskrit songs available to download on itunes & all digital platforms \nhttps://music.apple.com/gb/artist/gaiea-sanskrit/1464610074 \nor watch here: https://youtu.be/BY4xdELc1Gc\n____________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.
