    "description": "Excerpts from the teaching entitled \"Beyond Nothing\".\nThe full teaching can be found here - https://www.inner-quest.org/Siddharameshwar_E.htm\n\nSiddharameshwar Maharaj is one of the greatest unknown saints of the age who attained the highest abode of Eternal peace. He was born in August 1888 in the small village of Pathri, in the district Sholapur of India. From 1925 until 1936, he taught many disciples and helped dozens attain Self-realisation. His teachings were further spread around the globe by his most revered disciples, such as Ranjit Maharaj, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Muppin Kaadsiddheshwar Maharaj and Ganapatrao Maharaj Kannur. His samadhi shrine today is located at Banganga, Walkeshwar in Bombay.\n\nMusic: Meditative Mind - 528hz Floating in Space\nhttps://meditativemind.org/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM0YvsRfYfsniGAhjvYFOSA\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings, may it be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\nIf you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\u27a4  PayPal: using the email address: vivekahermitage@gmail.com\n Or this link: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage \n\u27a4  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\n\u00a0\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
