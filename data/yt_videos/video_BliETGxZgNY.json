    "description": "Clear and direct teachings for meditation instructions taken from 3 key teachings from the text \"An Unentangled Knowing\" by Upasika Kee - translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.\nThe full  text can be downloaded here: https://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/An-Unentangled-Knowing-Lessons-in-Training-the-Mind.pdf\n\nUpasika Kee Nanayon or Kor Khao-suan-luang (1901-1978) was a realized female practitioner from Thailand. She was mostly self-taught, reading the Pali canon and other Buddhist literature. She considered the Buddha's Dhamma as her primary teacher. Her dhamma talks and poetry were widely circulated. As word of her spread, she became one of the most popular meditation teachers in Thailand. This, and many of her talks, have been translated into English by Thanissaro Bhikkhu who sees her as \"arguably the foremost woman Dhamma teacher in twentieth-century Thailand.\"\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you for your enquiries about offering a donation to express your appreciation for this channel.
