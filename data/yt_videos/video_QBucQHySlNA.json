    "description": "Part 2 of excerpts from the teaching entitled \"Non-Action.\"\nThe full teaching can be found here - https://www.inner-quest.org/Siddharameshwar_Non-Action.htm\n\nSiddharameshwar Maharaj is one of the greatest unknown saints of the age who attained the highest abode of Eternal peace. He was born in August 1888 in the small village of Pathri, in the district Sholapur of India. From 1925 until 1936, he taught many disciples and helped dozens attain Self-realisation. His teachings were further spread around the globe by his most revered disciples, such as Ranjit Maharaj, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Muppin Kaadsiddheshwar Maharaj and Ganapatrao Maharaj Kannur. His samadhi shrine today is located at Banganga, Walkeshwar in Bombay.\n\nMusic: Peace - Deep Meditation - Trance - Deep Sleep \n_________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\ude4f May whatever goodness arises from these readings/offerings be for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 Thank you to everyone who has written to inquire about offering a donation to express appreciation for this channel.
