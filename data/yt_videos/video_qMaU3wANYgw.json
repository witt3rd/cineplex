    "description": "These beautiful, clear and profound pointers to the Truth were written as a poem by Sujatha Maheshwari, a regular listener of this channel and devotee of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.\n\nWith thanks for her kind permission to recreate them in this format for meditation purposes.\nSong - Om Varanam Namah\nArtist - Vicki Hansen\nFull track can be purchased here: https://music.apple.com/album/1434705796?app=itunes&ls=1\n\n\u00a0Here is the full text of the poem below:\n\nOneness\n~~~~~~~\n\nAll thoughts ... all feelings ... \nAll of the sensations that arise in the body ...\nAll experience ... all emotion ...\n\nWithout labels ...\nWithout judgment ... of good or bad, of right or wrong ...\nWithout even likes or dislikes or preferences ...\n\nWithout identification with an illusory sense of \"I\" ...\n\nAll of the energy that appears in the consciousness ...\nIs simply ... energy ...\n\nWithout innate substance or being,\nRecognized in its sameness ...\n\nAnd thus, in its inherent \nEmptiness ...\n& Purity ... \nClear, like the sky.\n\nAnd just like that ... the appearance of duality dissolves, \nReturning to the source from whence it arose. \n\n& With nothing left to see, \nAwareness gazes upon itself ...\n\nMerging with itself\n& Coming home to itself ...\n\nThe true Self is revealed.\n\n& I find myself resting \nIn the sublime knowing \nThat separation has only ever been an illusion.\n\nFor there have never been two.",
