    "description": "Excerpts read from the text - The Zen Teaching of Huang Po on the Transmission of Mind\nTranslated by John Blofeld.\n\nHuang-po (Huangbo Xiyun) was an influential Chinese Zen Master, and the teacher of Lin-chi (Rinzai) during the Tang Dynasty. Hu\u00e1ngb\u00f2 was a disciple of Baizhang Huaihai (720-840) There is not much information about the life of Huang Po. However he taught in the tradition of Zen Buddhism. Huang Po taught that enlightenment could be achieved by a silent mind and putting an end to conceptual thinking. This is a similar teaching to other Zen Masters such as Bodidharma and Dogen.\n\nMusic by Karunesh\nPlease note that all of my recordings can be downloaded via my Google Drive, details of which can be found under the COMMUNITY tab of the main page of my You Tube channel.\n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
