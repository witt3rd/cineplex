    "description": "VOCES8 performs Arvo P\u00e4rt's setting of the Nunc Dimittis.\n\nArvo P\u00e4rt invented his own compositional style called \u2018tintinnabuli\u2019, taken from the Latin for bell. This is his powerful setting of the Nunc Dimittis, committing the body to eternal rest. \n\nWe were inspired to create a video centered around the theme of cycles within nature, referencing our own mortality, with suggestions of the holy messenger in the deer, purity and love with the swan and finally the soul soaring up to heaven with the bird. The minimal setting of the music is reflected in the sparse use of colour, with inclusions of bright images that reference the ultimately uplifting nature of his beautiful music.\n\nThis track is recorded on VOCES8's album 'Winter' released on Decca Classics in 2016.",
