    "description": "Please note: these teachings are only suitable for those with a very good understanding, grasp, and deep respect for the perfection of the Master's teachings. Intended for deep meditation and contemplation.\n\nLongchenpa's Treasury of Natural Perfection - Radical Dzogchen\nI do not own the rights to this book. This is for educational and spiritual purposes only.\n\nDzogchen, or the \"Great Perfection,\" is considered by many to be the apex of Tibetan Buddhism, and Longchen Rabjam is the most celebrated of all the saints of this remarkable tradition. Natural Perfection presents the radical precepts of Dzogchen, pointing the way to absolute liberation from conceptual fetters and leading the practitioner to a state of pure, natural integration into one's true being.\n\nReading taken by the text translated by  Keith Dowman. PDF version of the book available freely online!\n\nThe beautiful music is by Hotel Neon.  https://hotelneon.bandcamp.com/",
