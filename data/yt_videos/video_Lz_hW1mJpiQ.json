    "description": "Excerpt read from the chapter \"Timeless Freedom\".  These  \"pointers\" from Longchenpa have been formatted for guided meditation purposes.   Taken from  the text  - A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission - A Commentary on the Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomena.\n\nTranslated by Richard Barron.\n\nSuitable and intended for experienced meditators who have an in depth understanding and practical insight into Dzogchen's perfection. This is an amazingly clear and powerful teaching for recognising timeless awareness as the state of timeless freedom.\n\nMusic: Meditative Mind  - Tibetan Healing Sounds\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2S_lVYxMsk&t=365s\n____________________________________________\n\n\ud83d\udd06 If you would like to sponsor this channel and support the development of a small nun\u2019s retreat hermitage:\n\n\u27a4 PayPal: https://paypal.me/VivekaHermitage\n\u27a4 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jayasara\n_______________________________________________\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A deep thank you to all donors for your offerings of generosity in support of this channel and its intention.\nEvery day I am deeply touched by your warm support and kind messages of gratitude.\n\nTurn on the '\ud83d\udd14' to get notifications for new releases! \n_______________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 As a Buddhist nun, my intention with this channel is to offer these creative adaptations of spiritual teachings for the purpose of deepening spiritual understanding, contemplation, meditation, healing, devotion and relaxation for listeners.
