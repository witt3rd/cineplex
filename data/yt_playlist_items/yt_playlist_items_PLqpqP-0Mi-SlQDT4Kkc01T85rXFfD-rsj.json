Discover more about developer Klei Entertainment and how a prototype from one of their yearly company game jams was the starting point for Don\u2019t Starve. The documentary also explores all the design decisions that the small four-person team made and why their first concepts and prototypes were designed as a free-to-play game.\n\nIt also takes a close look at all the hurdles Klei Entertainment had to go through. The concept art at the beginning of development looked drastically different from how Don\u2019t Starve looks today. Additionally, the team had many heated discussions about how to monetize their survival game. Furthermore, it delves into why the indie studio chose to launch a free beta version of Don\u2019t Starve on the Chrome Web Story and opted for a transparent development process that relied heavily on direct feedback from players. Lastly, it sums up all the lessons they learned throughout Don\u2019t Starve\u2019s entire development.\n\nSources:\nhttps://1drv.ms/b/s!AtL-iav41hYanTO8HLUjssS1bRhR\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5xnzCC-V2w&ab_channel=Noclip-VideoGameDocumentaries\n\nBeta gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRFwuo88bDo&ab_channel=TotalBiscuit\n\nBehind the scenes footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-46yR1dDXE&ab_channel=ElectricPlaygroundNetwork-EPN\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progress of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#DontStarve #KleiEntertainment #GameDevelopment",

Discover how Supergiant Games, the creators of Bastion, Transistor and Pyre, prioritized a transparent and inclusive development process before they even had the idea for their first roguelike dungeon-crawler. The documentary also explores all the design decisions that Supergiant Games made and why Theseus was originally going to be the protagonist instead of Zagreus.\n\nIt also takes a close look at the inspirations for the ink art style and why the team choose to introduce more diversity among the Olympian characters. Implementing a cohesive narrative within the roguelike genre also presented lots of challenges that the studio found clever solutions for. Furthermore, it explores how the developers used Early Access to create the best possible version of Hades.\n\nSources:\nhttps://1drv.ms/b/s!AtL-iav41hYanTKjrpg6io_efipx\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaTxFf7McU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQPk9J7spw0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYJ6d1ifSqA\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TultG_ojLqI\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progress of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#Hades #SupergiantGames #GameDevelopment",

The documentary also explores all the design decisions that Daisuke made and how Cave Story was inspired by some of Daisuke\u2019s favorite games.\n\nIt also takes a close look at all the hurdles Daisuke had to go through during development. As a solo developer, he was responsible for all the art, music, writing and programming. He did all this while also working full-time for a printer company, one of the reasons it took five years to develop Cave Story. Furthermore, it explores why Daisuke released the indie game completely free of charge. Lastly, the documentary explains how the PC port Cave Story+ and 3DS port Cave Story 3D came to be, as well as what Daisuke Amaya is up to now.\n\nSources:\nhttps://1drv.ms/b/s!AtL-iav41hYanS7wIFGP4FI46RU7\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NYJA-JGJx0&ab_channel=dada78641\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InfFJTVAMkw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOT4ocCFs6w&ab_channel=filmnstuff\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ep6dNobbuU&ab_channel=Espyo\n\nInterview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8XINfralSE&ab_channel=NintenDaanNC\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progress of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#CaveStory #DaisukeAmaya #GameDevelopment",

It explores all the design decisions that Edmund made and why he designed Isaac to fail.\n\nFurthermore, it also takes a close look at all the problems Edmund and his co-developer Florian Himsl faced during Isaac\u2019s development that started during a relaxing game jam. For example, the original Isaac was entirely made in Flash and this caused quite a lot of technical problems to get it to run properly on PC. Lastly, the documentary looks to the future to see what\u2019s still in store for The Binding of Isaac and when we can expect a sequel to the successful roguelike.\n\nSources:\nhttps://1drv.ms/b/s!AtL-iav41hYanSeVYlzC9zeaNaC2\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0JhD7Zehvc&ab_channel=arronmunroe\n\nInterviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2HgDpHGDLs&ab_channel=BraceYourselfGames\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJFsLJaZZ_4&ab_channel=NVIDIA\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progress of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#TheBindingOfIsaac #EdmundMcMillen #GameDevelopment",

        "description": "This Shovel Knight documentary details the development of the indie video game Shovel Knight and goes behind the scenes of its creation. Discover how a handful of ex-WayForward developers started Yacht Club Games and wanted to make a game that adopted a simpler style of gameplay, much like the classic NES games from the eighties. The documentary also explores how the Kickstarter initially almost barely got funded but eventually blew up almost overnight and unlocked every single stretch goal.\n\nIt also details all the design decisions that the studio made throughout development and how the team had to break the limitations of the NES to make Shovel Knight work. Furthermore, it delves into how Yacht Club Games ran out of money a couple of months before development and how it affected the team. Lastly, the documentary takes a look at why the developers burned out after developing the first additional campaign and what they did to recover from it.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/07/29/shovel-knight-devs-discuss-co-op-pogo-jumping-and-beyond.aspx\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/15/shovel-knight-when-castlevania-meets-mega-man\nhttps://www.usgamer.net/articles/game-dev-recipes-shovel-knight\nhttps://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/feature_playing_the_name_game_-_the_art_of_finding_the_perfect_title\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidDAngelo/20140625/219383/Breaking_the_NES_for_Shovel_Knight.php\nhttps://shovelknight.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Knight\nhttps://www.usgamer.net/articles/2014-recap-shovel-knights-surprisingly-affecting-storytelling\nhttps://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-making-of-specter-of-torment-part-1\nhttps://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/19/17992216/shovel-knight-book-boss-fight-yacht-club-games\nhttps://yachtclubgames.com/category/design\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2019/12/06/shovel-knight-director-sean-velasco-digs-into-yacht-club-games-past-and-future/\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/237629/Road_to_the_IGF_Yacht_Club_Games_Shovel_Knight.php\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/237629/Road_to_the_IGF_Yacht_Club_Games_Shovel_Knight.php\nhttps://kotaku.com/the-seven-year-saga-of-shovel-knight-is-finally-over-1840419716\nhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-08-06-shovel-knight-devs-break-down-costs-sales\nhttps://www.redbull.com/int-en/shovel-knight-digs-its-way-onto-wii-u\nhttps://www.redbull.com/int-en/shovel-knight-digs-its-way-onto-wii-u\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnP_fcGgdAQ&t&ab_channel=FCPlaythroughs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5tAbyd_nCs&t&ab_channel=ZeldaGamer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbtAlcOIKAk&ab_channel=TrontenRetro\n\nInterview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6a4ywXRxgs&t&ab_channel=kNIGHTWING01\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progress of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#ShovelKnight #YachtClubGames #GameDevelopment",

        "description": "This The Stanley Parable documentary details the development of the video game The Stanley Parable and goes behind the scenes of its creation. Discover how Davey Wreden started working on the original Half-Life 2 mod version of The Stanley Parable when he was a 19 year old film student. Davey created the mod all on his own and when he released it, it instantly became an immense success.\n\nDespite all the success, Davey felt very lost after the game\u2019s release, but thanks to the positive feedback from fans, he felt energized again and decided to remake the Half-Life 2 mod into a fully fledged game. He brought in developers from all over the world to help create the remake, including an independent developer named William Pugh. The duo were equal partners on the project, sharing the title of designer and writer. They set up their own studio called Galactic Cafe.\n\nThe documentary also explores all the design decisions that Davey and William made and how, after the game\u2019s release, the two developers struggled and parted ways. Lastly, the documentary also takes a look at how Davey and William found their way back to each other to create The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe edition.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/202359/Behind_the_scenes_with_The_Stanley_Parable.php\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/11/22/level-with-me-davey-wreden/#more-83225\nhttps://kotaku.com/the-stanley-parable-turns-video-game-storytelling-on-it-5829254\nhttps://www.shacknews.com/article/70363/interview-davey-wreden-on-stanley-parable-remake-and-self-taught\nhttps://www.wired.com/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/breaking-out-of-the-routine-player-agency-in-the-stanley-parable/1100-6413312/\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/13/stanley-clicked-yes-the-stanley-parable-returns/\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/16/postal-dad-stanliest-gnome-21-new-games-greenlit/\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/12/19/the-stanley-parable-now-available-for-mac.aspx\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-stanley-parable-released-for-linux-you-will-play-it-you-wont-play-it.5919\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2013/10/10/4823566/the-stanley-parable-demo-hands-on\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150209063143/http://www.stanleyparable.com/2013/10/a-postmortem-on-the-launch-of-the-stanley-parable/\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/10/20/the-stanley-parable-has-sold-more-than-100-000-copies-since-launch.aspx\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2013/10/21/4861948/the-stanley-parables-popular-demo-helped-make-the-game-a-success-dev\nhttps://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/a-pc-developers-tale-william-pugh-on-making-the-stanley-parable/\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/10/20/the-stanley-parable-has-sold-more-than-100-000-copies-since-launch.aspx\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-19-the-stanley-parables-ultra-deluxe-edition-has-been-delayed-until-next-year-again\nhttps://www.pcgamesn.com/the-stanley-parable/the-big-interview-william-pugh-closes-the-book-on-the-stanley-parable\nhttps://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=5626\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gblvOhnv2k0&t&ab_channel=MaximeLebled-3Danimator\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia3S1TkRavU&t&ab_channel=Supple\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_nF9vFh4MY&t&ab_channel=Santosx07\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOnxXJyOJ0s&t&ab_channel=GameGrumps\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbex71BucRI&t&ab_channel=Markiplier\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6xaO9QxmJw&t&ab_channel=PewDiePie\n\nInterviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Btc34eRsN8&t&ab_channel=GameLoading\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtU3JUFPPe4&ab_channel=CriticalPath\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOzdjXVt53s&t&ab_channel=PowerUnlimited\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB0OoYX9UfI&ab_channel=GDC\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGgLllLyVmA&t&ab_channel=Rev3Games\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icV3oliepKA&t&ab_channel=BAFTA\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progression of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#TheStanleyParable #DaveyWreden #WilliamPugh",

        "description": "This Celeste documentary details the development of the video game Celeste and goes behind the scenes of its creation. Discover how Celeste started out as a simple PICO-8 game that was developed in four days and grew to the beloved indie platformer we know today. Once developers Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry were done with the PICO-8 game they decided to assemble a team to expand it into a fully-fledged game.\n\nThe documentary also explores all the design decisions that the studio Matt Makes Games made and how the story of Celeste is very much a reflection of director Maddy Thorson\u2019s personal experience with anxiety. Lastly, the documentary also takes a look at what\u2019s next for the studio.\n\nSources:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180105123149/https://killscreen.com/articles/celeste/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2017/2/22/14701712/nintendo-switch-celeste-towerfall\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180105123137/https://killscreen.com/articles/celeste-insanely-difficult-insanely-cute-platformer-deserve/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2016/8/26/12666236/celeste-gameplay-video-towerfall-successor-matt-thorson-matt-makes-games-pax-west-indie-megabooth\nhttps://twitter.com/NoelFB/status/951470996854206464\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2018/12/28/18159575/celeste-collectors-edition-limited-run-games-release#:~:text=Limited%20Run's%20Celeste%20collector's%20edition,1%20at%2010%20a.m.%20ET.\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/09/09/celeste-has-set-off-on-its-final-farewell-update/\nhttps://twitter.com/exok_games/status/1169731121401040897\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/celeste-developer-says-that-a-sequel-is-not-in-the-works/\nhttps://www.usgamer.net/articles/celestes-designer-reveals-all-the-secret-ways-the-brutal-platformer-is-surprisingly-forgiving\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/333554/Celeste_has_sold_over_500000_copies_since_January.php\nhttps://www.destructoid.com/review-celeste-484157.phtml\nhttps://twitter.com/kuraine/status/967900071709761536\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-celeste-piano-album-is-coming-and-it-sounds-and-/1100-6464520/\nhttps://kotaku.com/celeste-taught-fans-and-its-own-creator-to-take-better-1825305692\nhttps://blog.playstation.com/2016/12/03/celeste-from-towerfall-creator-matt-thorson-hits-ps4-next-year/\nhttps://celestegame.tumblr.com/tools\nhttps://twitter.com/MattThorson/status/1278840712574799872\nhttps://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/01/feature_conquering_the_indie_mountain_with_celeste_creator_matt_makes_games\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-20-towerfall-devs-next-game-celeste-recalls-super-meat-boy\nhttps://nichegamer.com/2017/07/04/celeste-delayed-to-january-2018-for-pc-ps4-and-switch/\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/celestes-free-dlc-will-contain-more-than-100-levels/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDrdaCT0XU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3mbELVqAmo&t\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-nSjhIgmXc&ab_channel=MattThorson\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RlpMhBKNr0&ab_channel=GDC\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progression of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#Celeste #MattMakesGames #GameDevelopment",

Discover how developer Toby Fox came up with the idea for the unconventional RPG and how he wanted to challenge conventional RPG mechanics and tropes and fully embrace the video game medium. While Toby developed Undertale mostly on his own, he did receive help from several artists, most notably a friend of his named Temmie Chang.\n\nThe documentary also explores all the design decisions that Toby Fox made and how the game was inspired by a Wikipedia article about arrays. It also details how Toby Fox struggled with the success of Undertale and even caused a burnout. Lastly, the documentary also takes a look at Toby's next project Deltarune.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1002143342/undertale\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/a1eavt/has_it_been_revealed_what_programs_were_used_to/\nhttps://www.webcitation.org/6eg0CkoY2?url=https://seagaia.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/toby-foxs-undertale-dev-2-dev-interview-1/\nhttps://www.fangamer.com/products/undertale-art-book\nhttps://www.webcitation.org/6efmf8UHg?url=https://killscreen.com/articles/behind-humor-toby-foxs-undertale/\nhttps://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Digital_Media_Concepts/Toby_Fox#:~:text=Undertale%20was%20the%20first%20major,using%20the%20engine%20GameMaker%3A%20Studio.\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/the-making-of-undertale/\nhttps://medium.com/kickstarter/undertale-creator-toby-fox-on-the-indie-computer-game-that-s-become-an-industry-darling-fa4df6cee2db\nhttps://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Toby_Fox\nhttps://undertale.tumblr.com/page/11\nhttps://fwugradiation.tumblr.com/page/15\nhttps://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Undertale\nhttps://aminoapps.com/c/undertale/page/blog/undertale-concept-art-book-part-2/LD2i_8ueQ7n5a5RXGMJE6Yo8Vr8WqYw\nhttps://kotaku.com/undertale-creator-shares-notebook-full-of-early-concept-1790978697\nhttps://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/125361-Undertale-Dev-Every-Monster-Should-Feel-Like-an-Individual\nhttps://www.webcitation.org/6efnGRPgb?url=http://boingboing.net/2015/09/24/undertale-game.html\nhttps://www.webcitation.org/6efnlwrcn?url=http://indiegames.com/2015/10/thinking_for_ourselves_-_toby_.html\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/257471/How_Undertale_makes_you_think_hard_before_killing_monsters.php\nhttps://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Annoying_Dog\nhttps://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Temmie_Chang\nhttps://screenrant.com/undertale-video-game-facts-trivia/\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-02-undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet\nhttps://undertale.tumblr.com/post/150397346860/retrospective-on-undertales-popularity\n\nGameplay footage Undertale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-tAQHP_zCU\nGameplay footage Deltarune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmyNeAC0wow&t\nGameplay footage Touhou Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A6w_cqPGow&t\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progression of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#Undertale #TobyFox #GameDevelopment",

Discover how Ari Gibson and William Pellen became friends and eventually came up with the idea for Hollow Knight while participating in Game Jams together. Afterwards, they quit their jobs and founded their own Indie Studio called Team Cherry. After almost three years of development, the 2D platformer would go on to be a huge success, selling 2.8 million copies as of February 2019. Team Cherry announced a sequel called Silksong in 2019.\n\nThe documentary also explores all the design decisions that Team Cherry made and how the game started out as a top-down survival game. It also details how the developers wanted to make Hollow Knight stand out from other Metroidvania games and how challenging it was to balance the game\u2019s difficulty.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/2018/10/16/the-making-of-hollow-knight\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/1120881\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/6rvds8/we_are_team_cherry_the_developers_of_hollow/\nhttps://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-are-fine-with-players-missi-1828721254\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/04/hollow-knight-hidden-dreams/\nhttp://mossbag69.blogspot.com/2019/07/team-cherry-lore-and-plot-explained.html#:~:text=The%20name%20Team%20Cherry%20actually,basically%20the%20same%20game%2C%20guys.\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-design-a-great-metroidvania-map/?utm_content=bufferd26c5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer-pcgamertw\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/description\nhttps://teamcherry.com.au/\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progression of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#HollowKnight #TeamCherry #GameDevelopment",

        "description": "This Super Mario 64 documentary details the development of the video game Super Mario 64 and goes behind the scenes of its creation. Discover how Shigeru Miyamoto first had the idea for a 3D Mario game during the development of Star Fox on the SNES and how it was later inspired by a Yoshi prototype that was pitched by the UK-based development studio Argonaut Software. \n\nThe documentary also explores the many trials and tribulations the development team faced and takes a look at the many design decisions that were made during development of the Nintendo 64 launch title. Super Mario 64 became a huge success for Nintendo and was one of the main contributing factors of the Nintendo 64\u2019s initial popularity. It also set a new standard for 3D platformers and even to this day, it\u2019s still considered to be one of the best platformers around.\n\nSources:\nhttp://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html\nhttps://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Nintendo-Power/Issue-80?id=50566\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120216163241/http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html\nhttps://www.nsidr.com/archive/profile-shigeru-miyamoto\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-04-born-slippy-the-making-of-star-fox\nhttp://pixelatron.com/blog/the-making-of-super-mario-64-full-giles-goddard-interview-ngc/\nhttps://www.destructoid.com/mario-64-once-had-a-co-op-mode-156090.phtml\nhttps://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16386#.UERP19ZlRWw\nhttps://www.mariowiki.com/MIPS\nhttps://tcrf.net/Prerelease:Super_Mario_64_(Nintendo_64)#Development_Timeline\nhttps://kotaku.com/some-cool-stories-about-the-making-of-mario-64-1786928623\nhttp://shmuplations.com/mario64/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg8dzVg6Fow\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ7rVETzIwc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKBNzjgN_hk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjgaRzI853o\n\nGameplay footage by RetroGame.Stream channel on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3G4t6i5PAc&t=9143s\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progression of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#SuperMario64 #Nintendo #GameDevelopment",

        "description": "This Stardew Valley documentary details the development of the video game Stardew Valley and goes behind the scenes of its creation. Discover how Eric Barone, an Auburn native, made the very successful farming simulator RPG all by himself. Creating all the art, music, sound effects, dialogue and programming were a daunting task that had its ups and downs, but after four years of development, it all paid off for Eric. Stardew Valley would go on to be a huge success, selling 10 million copies as of January 2020.\n\nThe documentary also explores how Eric wanted to develop a small Harvest Moon clone at first, but eventually decided to expand the scope of his passion project and develop his dream version of what Harvest Moon could be. It also details why Eric Barone kept his real-life identity a secret for years and instead used his nickname ConcernedApe when he communicated about Stardew Valley\u2019s development.\n\nSources:\nhttps://gamasutra.com/view/news/267563/The_4_years_of_selfimposed_crunch_that_went_into_Stardew_Valley.php\nhttps://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-s-creator-has-won-the-hearts-of-pc-gamer-1762636730\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-interview/\nhttps://www.vulture.com/2016/03/first-time-developer-made-stardew-valley.html\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/see-what-stardew-valley-looked-like-four-years-before-it-was-finished/\nhttps://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-year-anniversary/\nhttps://cornellsun.com/2016/02/23/stardew-valley-pushing-the-boundaries-of-farming-rpgs/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2016/2/29/11134934/stardew-valley-steam-indie-farming-rpg-harvest-moon\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-creator-eric-barone-finally-has-a-decent-desk/\nhttps://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/03/the-past-present-and-future-of-stardew-valley/\nhttps://www.gq.com/story/stardew-valley-eric-barone-profile\nhttps://youtu.be/9YqdutJLIi8\n\nOutro song: Thank You R.G.E. - Joe Bagale\n\nFollow me on Twitter if you'd like to follow the progression of future videos: https://twitter.com/GlenCallaert\n\n#StardewValley #EricBarone #GameDevelopment",
