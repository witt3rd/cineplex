        "title": "Kleisli categories and probability - 01 - The Giry monad",
        "description": "This video introduces the Giry monad. A monad on a category consists of three data. In this case, it gives an endo-functor on the category of measurable spaces and measurable maps. The functor takes a measurable space to the space of probability measures and it takes a map to the pushforward of measures. In addition, there is a natural transformation that computes the barycenter of a probability measure on the space of probability measures. Finally, there is a natural transformation that views each point of a space as the Dirac delta distribution on that point. \n\nNote: I forgot to mention that the second pair of diagrams in the definition of a monad both equal the identity natural transformation for T. \n\nBrief history: In 1962, Bill Lawvere introduced the category of probabilistic maps. In 1982, Michele Giry viewed Lawvere's construction as the Kleisli category of a particular monad. \n\nThis video is part of the playlist on Categorical probability theory: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSx1kJDjrLRSKKHj4zetTZ45pVnGCRN80\n\nThe next video in this series is on the Kleisli category of a monad: https://youtu.be/m9KdSXHrHD8\n\nThese videos were created during the 2019 Spring/Summer semester at the UConn CETL Lightboard Room.",

        "description": "This video introduces the Kleisli category associated to a monad. Given a monad on a category, one can construct a new category that has the same objects as the original category but whose morphisms are slightly different. A morphism from X to Y in the Kleisli category is a morphism from X to P(Y) in the original category, where P is the functor from the monad. In the case of the Giry monad, such morphisms correspond to Markov kernels. The statement made at the end of a video is a relatively recent result by Abraham Westerbaan (https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01020). \n\nThis video is part of the playlist on Categorical probability theory: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSx1kJDjrLRSKKHj4zetTZ45pVnGCRN80\n\nThe next video in this series is on Markov kernels: https://youtu.be/psUDrasc21o\n\nThe previous video in this series is on The Giry monad: https://youtu.be/5t1FN_v7dB8\n\nThese videos were created during the 2019 Spring/Summer semester at the UConn CETL Lightboard Room.",

        "description": "This video provides the relationship between Kleisli morphisms and Markov kernels. We do this by more explicitly explaining what Kleisli morphisms look like. It also describes how the second natural transformation in the Giry monad (the one from P^2 to P---In this case, I'm calling the functor in the monad P instead of T) can be geometrically viewed as computing the barycenter of a probability measure on the space of probability measures. One can see this most easily using the space of probability measures on a finite set, which is a simplex. We also show how Kleisli composition reduces to the Chapman--Kolmogorov equation (integrating over the intermediate space in a pair of composable Kleisli maps). It reduces to matrix multiplication of stochastic matrices when the spaces are finite.   \n\nThis video is part of the playlist on Categorical probability theory: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSx1kJDjrLRSKKHj4zetTZ45pVnGCRN80\n\nThe next video in this series changes topics a bit and is on Conditional probabilities: https://youtu.be/xhDCmyDBj24\n\nThe previous video in this series is on The Kleisli category of a monad: https://youtu.be/m9KdSXHrHD8\n\nThese videos were created during the 2019 Spring/Summer semester at the UConn CETL Lightboard Room.",

        "description": "MIT Category Theory Seminar\n2019/02/21\n\nAbstract: I will explain how monads often arise as Kan extensions of graded monads. For example, the set of lists over an alphabet is the disjoint union of the sets of lists of each length. I will then show how this leads to a construction of a probability monad similar to the Giry monad. The graded monad approach lets us replace the use of measure theory by the combinatorics of finite sets, and makes precise the idea that a probability measure is an idealized version of a finite sample.",
