        "description": "Today's puzzle is one of the most incredible sudokus we've ever seen.  It's a debut on the channel for FinnishGuy and it's called Palindromaze.  And if, Squid Game-style, you had to solve this to survive, what would your strategy be?!  You can play the puzzle at the following link: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/DnhfRLQ8FF\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage. Grey lines in the grid are palindromes, which must read the same forwards and backwards. The clue outside the grid gives the sum of the digits along the indicated diagonal.  Digits can repeat along the diagonal if allowed by other rules. Cells separated by a white dot must contain consecutive digits.  Cells separated by a black dot must be in a 1:2 ratio.  Not all possible dots are given. Cells with a grey circle contain an odd digit.\n\n*** Our Patreon - The Best Sudoku Club In The World *** \nYou can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month and access a lot of extra content.

Please help us get there if you can!\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n\u25b6Today's Puzzle\u25c0\n\n\nIt's rare to come across sudokus that are genuinely witty but berni has done just that!  You can play the puzzle here:\n\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/webapp/L8jmdmmJP8\n\n\nRules: \n\n\nNormal sudoku rules apply.  If there is a V between two cells, the sum of the digits in the cells has to be 5. If there is an X between two cells, the sum of the digits in the cells has to be 10. If there is no sign between two cells, neither of the two properties above holds. All hints are \"knapp daneben\", that is, they are one before or one after the symbol, that should be there. \n\n\n\n**************************************************************\n\nOur Patreon page has lots of extra content including Scott Strosahl's Puzzle Hunt and Phistomefel's latest sudoku!\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n************************************************************************\nMiracle Sudoku is OUT on Android, Steam and App Store.  \n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377260/Miracle_Sudoku/\nApp Store:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527363795\nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.MiracleSudokuCTC\n\n\u25b6 CTC FAN DISCORD SERVER\u25c0\nhttps://discord.gg/BbN89j5\n\nNEW:  Guide To Our Discord Server:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCDiscordGuide\n\n\u25b6 OUR BACK CATALOGUE \u2013 ALL CATEGORISED WITH LINKS!\u25c0\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCCatalogue\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW THERMO SUDOKU APP IS OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thermo-sudoku/id1513994223  \nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ThermoSudoku\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1316390/Thermo_Sudoku/  \n\n\u25b6 *NEW* CRACKING THE CRYPTIC MERCHANDISE\u25c0 \nhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/cracking-the-cryptic\n\n\u25b6 OUR CHESS SUDOKU APP IS NOW OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-sudoku/id1500654482?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250560/Chess_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ChessSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR CLASSIC SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/classic-sudoku/id1488838275?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188330/Classic_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ClassicSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR SANDWICH SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandwich-sudoku/id1476116705?ls=1 \nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117310/Sandwich_Sudoku/  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.SandwichSudoku\n\n\u25b6SEND US PUZZLES TO SOLVE/CONTACT US\u25c0\ncrackingthecryptic@gmail.com\n\n\u25b6FOLLOW US\u25c0\nTwitter: #crypticcracking \n@crypticcracking\nInstagram (for how to solve daily clues from The Times): https://www.instagram.com/crackingthecryptic/?hl=en\n\n\u25b6SOFTWARE\u25c0\nPlay the puzzle in the video by clicking the link under the video (above).

        "description": "\u25b6 KICKSTARTER LINK\u25c0\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterchayward/cracking-the-cryptics-greatest-hits?ref=docedl\n\nThanks to everyone who has helped with our Kickstarter Campaign to create the greatest sudoku book in history.  Check out tonight's NEW stretch goals! Please support us if you can and please remember to vote for the 10 puzzles you'd like to see in the book (you can do this on kickstarter).\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n\u25b6Today's Puzzle\u25c0\n\nHappy Halloween!  Today's sudoku is another wonderful thematic affair from Ricky Cruz - \"Trick Or Treat\".  You can play it here:\n\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/webapp/MLPrTD2pB6\n\n\nRules:  (Note that there are some fantastic thematic rules below but it might be easier if you're solving in our software to use the formal rules, which come first.)    \n\n\nFormal rules: \n\nNormal sudoku rules apply.  Cells separated by a single knight's move (in chess) cannot contain the same digit.  Create a one-cell wide path in the grid to form a single loop that starts and ends in the central cell. The path must orthogonally touch each grey cell at least once but cannot enter any grey cell. The path cannot touch itself orthogonally. The central cell contains the lowest digit that can appear on the path. The path must visit each of the cells with a circle in them on them in strictly ascending order along the path (a cell is \"visited\" the first time the path orthogonally touches the cell). \n\n\nFlavourtext rules:\nIt's Halloween; time to plan your trick-or-treat route through the neighborhood!\nNormal sudoku rules apply; you're a dragon for Halloween this year, and dragons don't like knights! So if two cells are a chess knight's move apart, they cannot have the same digit.\nCreate a one-cell wide path around the neighborhood that orthogonally touches every house at least once, starting and ending at your house in the center cell.\nThe path cannot touch itself orthogonally, and cannot go through any house (except your house, of course). No cell on the path can be lower than the number in your house.\nFinally, the houses that have candy on them must be visited along the path in strictly ascending order (a house is visited the first time the path orthogonally touches the house). It is up to you to determine in what direction the path runs.\n\n\n**************************************************************\n\nOur Patreon page has lots of extra content including Scott Strosahl's Puzzle Hunt and Phistomefel's latest sudoku!

Can you unlock the secrets of the Wonders Of The World?!!  \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n*********************************************************************\nWe declare today's puzzle is perfect:  it's beautiful-looking, it uses the theme wonderfully and it's a really fun solve  Ricky Cruz has done it again and you can play his Frogger Sudoku here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/p27QN9Ldtj\n\nRules: \nIt's time to hit the arcade! In this grid, you need to take Frogger across the road and the river to reach one of the coloured frogs at the top of the screen.\n\nNormal sudoku rules apply. In addition, there is an orthogonally-connected path starting at Frogger (R9C5) that collects all flies in the grid and ends at one of the colored frogs (small circles) in the first row. The path cannot touch itself orthogonally, but can touch itself diagonally. The path also cannot go through the bushes (green cells) in the first row.\n\nCars and logs are found in the road and the river, respectively; they appear in those regions wherever two horizontally adjacent digits sum to 10. Frogger cannot go through cars, and can only hop across logs in the river.\n\n\u25b6 SIMON VS PHISTOMEFEL\u25c0\nIf you'd like to try the Phistomefel Yin-Yang Fillomino you can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/49gg9R9jT6\n\nRules and example puzzle can be found here:\nhttps://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00053V\n\nA video of Simon battling against this puzzle is available on Patreon now.\n\nPlease follow us on Twitter: @crypticcracking\n\n**************************************************************\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW KILLER SUDOKU APP IS OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS\u25c0\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/killer-sudoku-ctc/id1544165118\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1471910/Killer_Sudoku/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.KillerSudoku&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n\u25b6  SIMON REACTION BOARD (!) \u25c0\nWith thanks to Andrea for creating this :)\nhttps://simonreacts.avris.it/\n\n\u25b6 OUR MIRACLE SUDOKU APP IS OUT \u25c0\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377260/Miracle_Sudoku/\nApp Store:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527363795\nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.MiracleSudokuCTC\n\n\u25b6 CTC FAN DISCORD SERVER\u25c0\nhttps://discord.gg/BbN89j5\n\nNEW:  Guide To Our Discord Server:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCDiscordGuide\n\n\u25b6 OUR BACK CATALOGUE \u2013 ALL CATEGORISED WITH LINKS!\u25c0\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCCatalogue\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW THERMO SUDOKU APP IS OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thermo-sudoku/id1513994223  \nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ThermoSudoku\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1316390/Thermo_Sudoku/  \n\n\u25b6 *NEW* CRACKING THE CRYPTIC MERCHANDISE\u25c0 \nhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/cracking-the-cryptic\n\n\u25b6 OUR CHESS SUDOKU APP IS NOW OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-sudoku/id1500654482?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250560/Chess_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ChessSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR CLASSIC SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/classic-sudoku/id1488838275?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188330/Classic_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ClassicSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR SANDWICH SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandwich-sudoku/id1476116705?ls=1 \nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117310/Sandwich_Sudoku/  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.SandwichSudoku\n\n\u25b6SEND US PUZZLES TO SOLVE/CONTACT US\u25c0\ncrackingthecryptic@gmail.com\n\n\u25b6FOLLOW US\u25c0\nTwitter: #crypticcracking \n@crypticcracking\nInstagram (for how to solve daily clues from The Times): https://www.instagram.com/crackingthecryptic/?hl=en\n\n\u25b6SOFTWARE\u25c0\nPlay the puzzle in the video by clicking the link under the video (above).

        "description": "Today's puzzle is called CluedoKu, a mash-up of Cluedo and Sudoku, by Ricky Cruz.  Two of the suspects look familiar...  Can you find out who committed the crime?  Play the puzzle here:\n\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/webapp/jh6RDHdBmq\n\n\nRules: \n\n[Note the puzzle can be treated in two ways:  As a normal sudoku (Formal Rules below) or as the murder mystery (Flavourtext rules below).]\n\n\nFlavourtext rules: \n\nWelcome to Sudoku Manor, where normal sudoku rules apply! Along thermometers, digits must increase from the bulb... except for the digit in the central cell of the grid which is \"broken\", meaning its thermo functions without that digit but not with it.  (The broken cell may therefore repeat a digit from elsewhere on that thermo.) The murder occurred in one of the six 3x3 \"rooms\" (the upper and lower 3x3 boxes). The thermos in these rooms represent the six weapons, each of which is identified by the number in the center of its room. The six suspects are gathered in the centre room, represented by the colored cells. Each suspect's cell contains a number corresponding to one of the weapons; this shows which room each suspect was in at the time of the murder. The number in the broken cell of the central thermo is the key to discovering the killer; the killer was in the only room where the highest digit on that room's thermo equals the broken cell (other rooms' thermos are allowed to share highest digits). Can you crack this cryptic case?\n\n\nNormal rules:\nNormal sudoku rules apply. Along thermometers, digits must increase from the bulb. The marked square on the central thermo is \"broken\", meaning the thermo functions without that digit, but not with it. The broken cell may repeat a digit from elsewhere on the thermo. The center squares of the upper and lower 3x3 boxes contain all of the digits in the coloured squares of the central 3x3 box. The digit in the broken square of the central thermo is equal to the highest digit of exactly one of the other six thermos.\n\n\nThe Weapons (listed in ascending order of weapon numbers!):\nCandlestick\nDagger\nLead Pipe\nRevolver\nRope\nWrench\n\n\n**************************************************************\n\nOur Patreon page has lots of extra content including Scott Strosahl's Puzzle Hunt, which was released this afternoon!
