        "description": "Wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432850/Farewell_North/?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=devlog14\nJoin the Discord: https://farewell-north.com/discord\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/farewellnorth\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kylewbanks\nWebsite and Email Newsletter: https://farewell-north.com\n\nThere\u2019s been a ton of progress since last month, so there\u2019s a lot to go over in this devlog!\n\nI\u2019ve been continuing to take your feedback to heart, and I think I finally figured out how to make the canoe system interesting and fun. I\u2019ll show you how I created all-new animations, reworked the controls, and improved the propulsion, VFX and SFX to drastically improve the canoe system.\n\nI also made some more progress on the monster from the last devlog, improving its visuals and completing two of its three attack states. Most of this was done in Blender for the visuals and using procedural animation for the movement, along with VFX Graph in Unity for the visual effects. There\u2019s still work to be done here, but the feedback last time was so positive that I wanted to show you where it\u2019s at. \n\nAside from these two feature updates, there\u2019s also been a lot of technical work behind-the-scenes this month. First, the whole audio system has been overhauled and integrated with FMOD to allow for much more adaptive and dynamic audio in the game. This was a time consuming process, but will be well worth the effort. Second, I\u2019ve made a number of performance enhancements to the game as I prepare to scale from the early intro areas into the full game map. Speaking of which, a big milestone this month in that the first 10 minutes of the game have been polished and finalized and are ready for play testing in the upcoming alpha build of the game\u2019s demo. That\u2019ll be going out to friends and family first, followed by a private beta in the Discord so make sure to join (link above) if you want to help test!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video, and please leave your thoughts down below. Don't forget to like, subscribe and of course, wishlist the game on Steam!\n\nOriginal Score by John Konsolakis: www.johnkonsolakis.eu\n\nFarewell North is my personal passion project, an open world adventure game about restoring color to a dark and desolate archipelago where all color and life has left. You play as a collie working alongside your human companion to explore, solve puzzles, evade monsters, and restore color to the islands. \n\n#devlog #gaming #videogames #indiedev #indiegame #gamedev #unity #unity3d #madewithunity #steam #steamgame #journey #blender",

What can altered realities teach us about the world, and our place in it? \n\n\ud83d\udc0d Sign up for my weekly newsletter: https://clarkelieson.com/\n\nSupport me: https://www.patreon.com/ClarkElieson\n\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/clarkelieson\n\nAll Links below are affiliated with Amazon. \n\nList of Books Referenced In This Video: \n- An Introduction to Transcendental Phenomenology by Edmund Husserl\nhttps://amzn.to/2VaNuUB\n- Being and Time, by Martin Heidegger \nhttps://amzn.to/3yxwGps\n- Building, Dwelling, Thinking by Martin Heidegger\nhttps://amzn.to/3dS6YUt\n- What is Metaphysics? by Martin Heidegger\nhttps://amzn.to/3dS6YUt\n- The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus\nhttps://amzn.to/3dS712B\n- The Questioning Concerning Technology by Martin Heidegger\nhttps://amzn.to/3dS6YUt\n- Nausea by Jean-paul Sartre\nhttps://amzn.to/3dPibW3\n- On The Psychology of the Uncanny by Ernst Jentsch\n- The Uncanny by Sigmund Freud\nhttps://amzn.to/3xqzGDC\n- Acquainted with the Night by Robert Frost\nhttps://amzn.to/3hjP5jt\n\nOther Related Works:\n-House of Leaves\nhttps://amzn.to/3hEDv1C\n-Langoliers \nhttps://amzn.to/3Aydc5D\n-Ugly, The Aesthetics of Everything\nhttps://amzn.to/2Vfx6lT\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro\n4:11 Chapter 2: No Exit\n8:06 Chapter 3: The Infinite\n12:31 Chapter 4: The Uncanny\n20:39 Chapter 5: The Nothing\n\nMusic:\nThe End - C418\nJust A Burning Memory (from Everywhere At the End of Time) - The Caretaker\nImposter Win from Among Us \nLate Night in Ninsei - Abomindable Beat Machine\nFallout 1 OST\nFnaf 4 Menu Theme \nHalf-Life 2 OST\nWindows 96 - Bonita Camisa \nYume Nikki OST\nMario Paint\n\n@Solar Sands \n#LiminalSpaces #LiminalSpace #AlteredReality",

        "description": "I've been recently obsessing over liminal spaces and the eerie feeling they evoke. I noticed that much of the art appeals to American nostalgia because it depicts images from a typical American childhood-- pre-fab suburbia, lingering 80s architechture, shopping malls, Chuck e cheese style birthdays, etc. As a person who grew up partially in Russia, I found myself unable to relate to many of the images I saw. Thus, I decided to compile images of specifically Russian and post-Soviet liminal spaces, which eventually turned into this video project.\n\nImages were found using Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google Images. Images were edited by me using Windows photo editor (messed around with the color/tone settings), MS Paint, and Paint Tool Sai. Audio was pitched down and given reverb using Audacity. Final product was edited in Windows Video Editor and Openshot.\n\nHello Solar Sands viewers, welcome :) and hello TikTok people as well! Most Russian dreamcore/liminal space videos on there use my video as a source. Special shout-out to @dream.core\n\nSong: https://youtu.be/KIBhKAxQUbk\n\nPolish/Post-Soviet Liminal Space: https://youtu.be/OyqLZnox2Y8\n\nIf you've scrolled this far, congratulations! You've made it to the bonus images that didn't make the final cut: https://imgur.com/a/OXWvlfL",

        "description": "\"Do you have the courage? Do you have the will? Do you have the love to propel you to awaken from your own dream of life, and realize the truth that you are the dreamer?\"\n\n-\n\nIf you enjoyed this video please click the like button and subscribe to our channel for more spiritual wisdom from Shunyamurti. \n\nNEWSLETTER: For the latest Shunyamurti teachings subscribe to our free newsletter: http://bit.ly/2sa1pJh\n\nMEMBERS SECTION: An online portal to the more advanced teachings of Shunyamurti: https://www.satyoga.org/spiritual-teachings\n\nABOUT SHUNYAMURTI: Shunyamurti\u2019s life-long quest for truth and the power of healing our souls and our world has brought about a deep understanding of the dynamics of the traumatized ego, the karmic trajectory and wounds of the soul, and the radiant healing power of the Supreme Real that is the One Self. He has learned how to work on all levels simultaneously to help sustain the ecstasy of Self-realization. Many years of meditation practice and training in numerous forms of yoga, including apprenticeship with Baba Hari Dass, ten years of vowed association with a Brahmachari ashram in India, a special resonance with Sri Ramana Maharshi and a deep study of Advaita and esoteric Shaivism and Buddhism, have been supplemented by the intensive study of western metaphysics, modern sciences, profound exploration of the dimensions opened by entheogens, trans-personal psychology, various forms of psychoanalysis and Jungian dreamwork, and the entire development of the perennial philosophy, including Taoism, Kabbalah, and mystical Christianity. Shunyamurti now functions as spiritual guide, retreat leader, and teacher of the Sat Yoga Ashram and Community, in addition to his ongoing advanced research in the Yogic sciences. https://www.satyoga.org/shunyamurti  \n\nJOIN SHUNYAMURTI: Visit our website for more information about joining Shunyamurti for a retreat, Meditation Weekend, or Immersion Program at the Sat Yoga Ashram, Costa Rica \n\nFOLLOW US ONLINE \nWebsite: https://www.satyoga.org/ \nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/satyogainstitute\nInstagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/satyogaashram\nSpotify:\u00a0https://open.spotify.com/show/135j7XjUoaTOn1cCTWcBJS\niTunes:\u00a0https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spiritual-teachings-with-shunyamurti/id312136041?mt=2\nPodbean:\u00a0http://satyoga.podbean.com/\n\n[To All Who Listen to Shunyamurti\u2019s Teachings: Thank you all for your serious consideration of these ideas, which are intended to help you live a more coherent, peaceful, creative, compassionate, and productive life, and to be of service to the welfare of our world. We understand that our approach to existential concerns is not for everyone. We honor your right to disagree with these ideas and to stop listening if you do not like them. We gladly post comments with disagreements, if they are stated in a positive and mature manner, that allows civilized discourse about your own contrary ideas, and which may spark further useful and profound thought about the important issues that the teachings raise. If there are sincere questions about the teachings, or misunderstandings that can be clarified, Shunyamurti is always ready and willing to respond with helpful elaborations and even to cite texts and other authors whose writings may be of assistance to serious seekers. But comments that are simply angry and insulting, immature and unreasonable, will be removed because they undermine the educational and inspirational purpose of this project. Those who have questions that are more personal should write us in a private email and one of the teachers in our wisdom school will respond in the same way, or if the question is a very subtle or difficult one and requires a response from Shunyamurti, we will forward it to him on your behalf, and when he can, he will respond personally. By the way, we want to clarify that these teachings are new, they are not simply a repetition of old traditional teachings, but integrate current thought in the sciences, psychology, cultural studies, and philosophy. Shunyamurti speaks from his own realizations and deep clinical experience as a healer.] \n\n#satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening #karma #meditation #yoga #satyoga #ego",
