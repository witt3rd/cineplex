        "title": "A Guide to Stoicism by St George Stock Full Audiobook",
        "description": "Full Audiobook - A Guide to Stoicism by St. George William Joseph Stock read by Bill Boerst\n\nSummary\nSt. George Stock authored the Guide to Stoicism, also published as A Little Book on Stoicism. Stoicism was a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics considered destructive emotions to be the result of errors in judgment, and that a sage, or person of \"moral and intellectual perfection,\" would not undergo such emotions. Stoics were concerned with the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. If you strip Stoicism of its paradoxes and its willful misuse of language, what is left is simply the moral philosophy of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, dashed with the physics of Heraclitus. Stoicism was not so much a new doctrine as the form under which the old Greek philosophy finally presented itself to the world at large. It owed its popularity in some measure to its extravagance. A great deal might be said about Stoicism as a religion and about the part it played in the formation of Christianity but these subjects were excluded by the plan of this volume which was to present a sketch of the Stoic doctrine based on the original authorities.",

        "description": "Audio book Part 1 - Crime And Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n\nCrime and Punishment (Russian: Prestupleniye) i nakazaniye;  is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoyevsky's full-length novels following his return from 10 years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his \"mature\" period of writing.\n\nCrime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, in attempts to defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.",

        "title": "The Secret Of Light By Walter Russell (Unabridged Illustrated Audiobook)",
        "description": "This one of my favorite most mind blowing projects which has laid me asunder since I read it.  This book was so amazing there is no way I can describe it.  It is like nothing I have ever read before.  It is like a 6 hour magic spell. Some of it will just go by without understanding but once you are done you have entered into the divine mind of god and truly understand the law of one in its rawest most perfect explanation ever.  He was also an amazing illustrator and I feature many of his best illustrations in which he seemingly maps out the universe by pen, heart and mind. \n\n\nThe author challenges the conventional wisdom that light is just another physical entity. He outlines a new role of light in the formation of the three main components of the universe - God, still light; the dual light waves emanated from God and the material world both organic and inorganic which is made of light bent into various spiral forms. Reading this book \"is an important step toward understanding both the intellectual and spiritual balances that exist in the universe.\" \n\n\nThe Divine Iliad is the basis of this book\n\n\n\"The Divine Iliad is an inspired message from the Creator to give man the needed comprehension of his relation to his universe, to man, and to God, for the coming cycle. \n\nMan progresses in cycles of approximately twenty-five hundred years. At the beginning of each cycle of his growing awareness of the Light within it, God sends messages through prepared messengers to further his comprehension of the Light. Comprehension of these cosmic messages gradually exalts mankind into higher beings, and thus each cycle is one more step for man toward full awareness of the Light, and of his Oneness with God. \n\n\nWalter Russell \n\n\nBUY MY BOOK! https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Revolution-Mind-Blowing-Movement-Hack/dp/154450618X/\n\nListen my book on audible https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Reality-Revolution-Audiobook/B087LV1R5V\n\n\n\nMusic By Mettaverse\nnocturne\ninto the omniverse\njourney into the multiverse\nsubtle energies\nsolar winds\ngolden lotus\n\n\n\n\u27a4 Listen on Soundcloud: http://bit.ly/2KjGlLI\n\n\u27a4 Follow them on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JW8BU2\n\n\u27a4 Join them on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2G1j7G6\n\n\u27a4 Subscribe to their channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvjffON2NoUvX5q_TgvVkw\n\nAll My Neville Goddard Videos In One Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo8kBZsJpp3xvkRwhbXuhg0M\n\nAll my videos about Dr. Joseph Murphy - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo_OtBhXg2s85UuZBT-OihF_\n\nFor coaching \u2013 https://www.advancedsuccessinstitute.com\n\nFor all episodes of the Reality Revolution \u2013 https://www.therealityrevolution.com\n\nLike us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/RealityRevolutionPodcast/\n\nJoin our facebook group The Reality Revolution https://www.facebook.com/groups/403122083826082/\n\nSubscribe to my Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOgXHr5S3oF0qetPfqxJfSw\n\nContact us at media@advancedsuccessinsitute.com\n#walterrussell #secretoflight #universalone #light #universalmind",

        "description": "\"Your own wonderful human imagination is the actual creative power of God within you. It is your savior. If you were thirsty, water would be your savior. If you needed a job, employment would be your savior. Your imagination is the power to save you from whatever circumstances you now find yourself. You can experience your heart\u2019s desire through the use of your imagination. Nothing is impossible to your imagination. Your imagination is unlimited in what it can accomplish. If you can imagine something, you can achieve it. Let me give you an example. If you were unable to walk and were confined to a wheelchair, you could close your eyes and imagine yourself running on the beach or wading in the water. If you would imagine yourself doing this until it took on the tones of reality, you could accomplish a healing that would allow you to actually walk or run.\"\n\nRead in 2018 by Josiah Brandt with reverence, pause, emphasis and effect.\n\nLike and subscribe to receive notifications when new Neville lectures and books are posted, read as they were originally intended to be read - by a real human! It is my intention to honor these words with my voice. I trust they will bring you much joy.\n\n**This lecture, \"Imagination Creates Reality\" is also titled \"Consciousness\". The original text includes  several pages of \"Case Histories\" which are not included in this narration.",

        "title": "Walter And Lao Russell - Opening The Door To True Power",
        "description": "Meditation is the key that will open the door to your inner-Self wherein lies all the true power for material manifestation, for, as sound springs from silence, so does positive action come from inner KNOWING. It has been said that one must lose one's life to find it. Applied to meditation, it means that one must lose (forget) one's mortal body in order to become aware of one's immortality. \n\n\nThat is exactly what happens when we seek the Light of Self-illumination in our eternal Selves. The great glory of existence is reached only by Mind-awareness. You can only reach supreme heights that wav. In that ecstatic existence is the seed and Source of all power and all-knowledge, which is yours by just desiring it. \n\n\nIt is not easy to acquire the meditative state all at once even as carefully as these lessons tell you how to acquire it. It must come slowly and always through desire to talk with God. There is no other way. You must either desire to live in the sensed body of earth or in the Light of the Mind-kingdom of heaven. \n\n\nThat is the answer to those who say they try to meditate but find that they cannot stop thinking to \"get into that state of Mind.\" To those who are thus troubled in making the transition, we would say that if you desired to talk to the President of the United States, your Mind would be centered on the reason why you desired to talk to him. \n\n\nExactly the same procedure takes place when you wish to talk with God. Your Mind is centered on your desire. You could not possibly think of other things, nor could your thinking wander aimlessly. \n\n\nConcentrate hard upon your desire if you wish to, or just breathe your desire softly, or just write it upon your heart wordlessly. Perhaps your desire has no definite objective other than to find the peace of heavenly companionship by dwelling in the love nature of your Self and God. \n\n\nIt makes no difference what your desire is, or whether your approach is in deep concentration upon some specific thing, or in dreamy decentration upon some nebulous idea \u2014 or upon nothing at all. You cannot concentrate long in any case, not more than five to ten minutes, before the reaction of decentration replaces it. \n\n\nGradually the inspiration you ask for will come to you. Before you can realize it, you will find yourself \"stepping in and out of the body\" in that alternation which always takes place while losing your sensed-awareness. \n\n\nGradually you will completely forget your body and have full awareness of the Light of knowing, which Mind is.\n\n -Lao and Walter Russell\n\nAlternate Universe Reality Activation  get full access to new meditations, new lectures, recordings from the reality con and the 90 day AURA meditation schedule\nhttps://realityrevolutionlive.com/aura45338118\n\nBUY MY BOOK! https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Revolution-Mind-Blowing-Movement-Hack/dp/154450618X/\n\nListen my book on audible https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Reality-Revolution-Audiobook/B087LV1R5V\n\nThis information is mindblowing.\n\nMusic by Mettaverse\nthe language of light\n\n\u27a4 Listen to them on Soundcloud: http://bit.ly/2KjGlLI\n\u27a4 Follow them on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2JW8BU2\n\u27a4 Join them on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2G1j7G6\n\u27a4 Support their Work at Patreon: http://bit.ly/2TXQhu3\n\u27a4 Subscribe to their channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvjffON2NoUvX5q_TgvVkw\n\nThe Home Study Course playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo9SxrM97CZ40xTvWXh1zGPj\n\nAll my Walter Russell videos - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo-9Oguc4o0PlZVfpKD-H2Kz\n\nAll My Lao Russell Videos - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo9kB-BKSGP3KLc8p5dlfUwY\n\nThe law of One Playlist - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo9YW0EjSjbVh94EFlOU_Czw\n\nHow To Meditate - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo_W8G0bCs1qSdQni9oOvX2N\n\nFor all episodes of the Reality Revolution \u2013 https://www.therealityrevolution.com\n\nAll My Neville Goddard Videos In One Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo8kBZsJpp3xvkRwhbXuhg0M\n\nAll my videos about Dr. Joseph Murphy - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKv1KCSKwOo_OtBhXg2s85UuZBT-OihF_\n\nLike us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/The-Reality-Revolution-Podcast-Hosted-By-Brian-Scott-102555575116999\n\nJoin our facebook group The Reality Revolution https://www.facebook.com/groups/523814491927119\n\nSubscribe to my Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOgXHr5S3oF0qetPfqxJfSw \n\nContact us at media@advancedsuccessinsitute.com\n\n#walterrussell #laorussell #light #meditation #greatawakening",

        "title": "The Book of Five Rings - (Audiobook) - by Miyamoto Musashi (Go Rin No Sho)",
        "description": "The Book of Five Rings was written nearly 400 years ago in Japan, and is about swordsmanship and strategy. Due to it's subject matter it's difficult to draw lessons and parallels to the modern world without taking quite an abstract view of the author's meaning, however there is an underlying philosophy running through it, and it's an important work which is still read today in Japan and a few people had requested it so I thought I'd do a recording.

There have been various translations made over the years, and it enjoys an audience considerably broader than only that of martial artists and people across East Asia: for instance, some foreign business leaders find its discussion of conflict and taking the advantage to be relevant to their work in a business context. The modern-day Hy\u014dh\u014d Niten Ichi-ry\u016b employs it as a manual of technique and philosophy.\n\nMusashi establishes a \"no-nonsense\" theme throughout the text. For instance, he repeatedly remarks that technical flourishes are excessive, and contrasts worrying about such things with the principle that all technique is simply a method of cutting down one's opponent. He also continually makes the point that the understandings expressed in the book are important for combat on any scale, whether a one-on-one duel or a massive battle. Descriptions of principles are often followed by admonitions to \"investigate this thoroughly\" through practice rather than trying to learn them by merely reading.\n\nMusashi describes and advocates a two-sword fencing style (nit\u014djutsu): that is, wielding both katana and wakizashi, contrary to the more traditional method of wielding the katana two-handed. However, he only explicitly describes wielding two swords in a section on fighting against many adversaries. The stories of his many duels rarely refer to Musashi himself wielding two swords, although, since they are mostly oral traditions, their details may be inaccurate. Musashi states within the volume that one should train with a long sword in each hand, thereby training the body and improving one's ability to use two blades simultaneously.",

        "description": "Adapted by Mike Walker.\n\n\"The Navidson Record now stands as part of this country's cultural experience and yet, in spite of the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have seen it, the film continues to remain an enigma. Some insist it must be true, others believe it is a trick on a par with the Orson Welles radio romp The War of the Worlds. Many more have never even heard of it.\"\n\nWith these words Zampano preludes the excerpts from an extraordinary film, cut together by Will Navidson from cameras located within his house and those he took with him into the labyrinth that had sprung up there over the course of a few days.\n\nAccording to the Navidson record, it was when the family returned to the house from a trip to Seattle that they first discovered the additional door and the space behind it. Will Navidson, celebrated adventure photographer, was intrigued, his partner Karen insisted that the door be permanently locked. But one night after a row, Navidson opened the door and went in. He found rooms beyond rooms, all windowless, all unlit, and only narrowly escaped becoming lost forever in the labyrinth. Not long afterwards the spiral staircase appeared, corkscrewing downwards to a dark infinity. So Navidson equipped his brother Tom and others for an expedition, as if they were embarking on a quest into some architectural jungle. The cameras rolled and they descended, and here's the audio.\n\nHouse of Leaves is the remarkable cult novel by Mark Z Danielewsky, a labyrinth of its own kind with its multiple interwoven narratives and textual tricks. This dramatic piece re-imagines the terrifying heart of the story.\n\nThe narrator in this production is Jim Norton who recently received both an Olivier award for the National Theatre production and a Tony for the hit Broadway production of Conor McPherson's The Seafarer, and is currently appearing again at the National in McPherson's new play The Veil.\n\nProducer/Director: John Taylor\nA Fiction Factory production for BBC Radio 4.",
