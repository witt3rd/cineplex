        "description": "MIT Category Theory Seminar\n2020/08/13\n\n\u00a9Spifong\n\nSpeaker: Toby St. Clere Smithe\n\nTitle: Active Inference and Compositional Cybernetics\n\nAbstract:\nCybernetic systems are those that interact with their environment to achieve some goal, though this goal may only be to continue existing. Many such systems can be characterized as performing \"active\" Bayesian inference: dynamically inferring the relevant external state and the course of action expected to achieve the goal. We introduce these ideas and present some first steps towards their categorical formalization as dynamical realisations of \"statistical open games\", concentrating on examples from neuroscience and machine learning. We show that Bayesian updates compose according to the \"lens\" pattern, thereby giving an abstract justification for the bidirectionality empirically observed in cortical circuits. Finally, we sketch on-going work on the structure of nested and interacting cybernetic systems. \n\nMore videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgq-BqyZ7i6Vh4nxlyhKDAMhlv1oWl5n\n\nMain page:\nhttp://brendanfong.com/seminar.html",

        "title": "Mathematical Challenges to Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution",
        "description": "Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.\n\nTo comment please go to\nhttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathematical-challenges-darwins-theory-evolution-david-berlinski-stephen-meyer-and-david\n\nBased on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or\u00a0replaced with a theory of intelligent design?\n\nHas Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin\u2019s theory in their two books and essay, respectively\u00a0The Deniable Darwin,\u00a0Darwin\u2019s Doubt, and \u201cGiving Up Darwin\u201d (published in the\u00a0Claremont Review of Books).\n\nRobinson asks them to convince him that the term \u201cspecies\u201d has not been defined by the authors to Darwin\u2019s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin\u2019s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): \u201cBeauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe\u2014walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track\u2014most of the time.\u201d Gelernter notes that there\u2019s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture\u2014not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin\u2019s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.\n\nFor further information: \nhttps://www.hoover.org/publications/uncommon-knowledge\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

        "title": "More (Theme from Mondo Cane) - Seven Fantastic Artist! (Lyrics) (1962) 1080p",
        "description": "\"More (Theme from Mondo Cane)\" is a film score song written by Riz Ortolani and Nino Oliviero for the 1962 film Mondo Cane. The movie's music was released as Mondo Cane: Original Motion Picture Sound Track Album, music by Riz Ortolani and Nino Oliviero, on United Artists Records.\n\nOriginally composed as an instrumental and titled \"Ti guarder\u00f2 nel cuore\", lyrics were later provided by Marcello Ciorciolini, which were adapted into English by Norman Newell. At that point, \"Theme from Mondo Cane\" became \"More\" (not to be confused with an earlier pop song of the same name).\n\nThe song was recorded in several languages by Steve Rossi who continues to perform the song in his Las Vegas stage acts. Mr. Rossi performed the song at the 36th Academy Awards and is best known as one half of the comedy team Allen and Rossi.\n\n\"More\" is one of Ortolani's most acclaimed and influential works. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 36th Academy Awards in 1963, and it led Ruggero Deodato to hire Ortolani to compose the score for his film Cannibal Holocaust. - Wikipedia \n\n+++\n\nLYRICS:\n\nMore than the greatest love the world has known\nThis is the love I'll give to you alone\nMore than the simplest words I try to say\nI only live to love you more each day!\n\nMore than you'll never know my arms long to hold you so\nMy life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping\nLonger than always is long long time, \nBut far beyond forever you'll be mine!\n\nI know I never lived before and my heart is very sure\nNo one else could love you more!\n\nI know I never lived before and my heart is very sure\nNo one else could love you more!\n\n+++\n\n\"MORE\" SONG LIST ARTIST:\n\nArthur Fiedler & The Boston Pops Orchestra, Ferrante & Teicher, Andy Williams, Hill Bowen, Morton Gould, The Hollywood Strings & BBC Symphony Orchestra\n\n+++\n\nMusic From When Lyrics Were\nBoth Beautiful & Romantic!\n\n+++\n\nSONG INFO:\n\nMore - BBC Band\nSound recording\n20:51 - 25:07  play match\nThe Orchard Music\nKM Records\nOn behalf of: San Juan Records / Matrak\nMonetized by copyright owner\nRemove song \nFile a dispute \n\nMore - Mantovani Orchestra\nSound recording\n17:22 - 19:59  play match\nThe Orchard Music\nOn behalf of: Platinum Collection\nMonetized by copyright owner\nRemove song \nFile a dispute \n\nMore (Theme from \"Mondo Cane\") - Morton Gould and His Orchestra\nSound recording\n13:27 - 17:17  play match\nSME\nOn behalf of: RCA/Legacy\nBlocked in some countries \nRemove song \nFile a dispute \n\nMore - Ferrante & Teicher\nSound recording\n3:58 - 7:05  play match\nUMG\nOn behalf of: EMI Catalogue\nBlocked in some countries \nRemove song \nFile a dispute \n\nMore - Andy Williams\nSound recording\n7:10 - 9:37",

This stage is most like a beautiful daydream. \nThe glory of old age and recollection. The last of the great days. \n\n00:00:00 - A1 - It's just a burning memory\n00:03:32 - A2 - We don't have many days\n00:07:02 - A3 - Late afternoon drifting \n00:10:38 - A4 - Childishly fresh eyes\n00:13:36 - A5 - Slightly bewildered\n00:15:38 - A6 - Things that are beautiful and transient\n00:20:12 - B1 - All that follows is true\n00:23:44 - B2 - An autumnal equinox\n00:26:31 - B3 - Quiet internal rebellions\n00:30:02 - B4 - The loves of my entire life\n00:34:06 - B5 - Into each others eyes\n00:38:42 - B6 - My heart will stop in joy\n\nSTAGE 2 : 00:41:22\nThe second stage is the self realisation and awareness that something is wrong with a refusal to accept that. More effort is made to remember so memories can be more long form with a little more deterioration in quality. The overall personal mood is generally lower than the first stage and at a point before confusion starts setting in. \n\n00:41:22 - C1 - A losing battle is raging\n00:46:01 - C2 - Misplaced in time \n00:50:44 - C3 - What does it matter how my heart breaks\n00:53:22 - C4 - Glimpses of hope in trying times\n00:58:06 - C5 - Surrendering to despair\n01:03:09 - D1 - I still feel as though I am me \n01:07:17 - D2 - Quiet dusk coming early\n01:10:54 - D3 - Last moments of pure recall\n01:14:47 - D4 - Denial unravelling\n01:19:02 - D5 - The way ahead feels lonely\n\nSTAGE 3 : 01:23:17\nHere we are presented with some of the last coherent memories before confusion fully rolls in and the grey mists form and fade away. Finest moments have been remembered, the musical flow in places is more confused and tangled. As we progress some singular memories become more disturbed, isolated, broken and distant. These are the last embers of awareness before we enter the post awareness stages.\n\n01:23:17 - E1 - Back there Benjamin\n01:27:33 - E2 - And heart breaks\n01:31:38 - E3 - Hidden sea buried deep\n01:32:59 - E4 - Libet's all joyful camaraderie\n01:36:12 - E5 - To the minimal great hidden\n01:37:53 - E6 - Sublime beyond loss\n01:40:03 - E7 - Bewildered in other eyes\n01:41:55 - E8 - Long term dusk glimpses\n01:45:29 - F1 - Gradations of arms length\n01:47:00 - F2 - Drifting time misplaced\n01:51:16 - F3 - Internal bewildered World\n01:54:45 - F4 - Burning despair does ache\n01:57:22 - F5 - Aching cavern without lucidity\n01:58:41 - F6 - An empty bliss beyond this World\n02:02:19 - F7 - Libet delay\n02:06:15 - F8 - Mournful cameraderie\n\nSTAGE 4 : 02:08:53\nPost-Awareness Stage 4 is where serenity and the ability to recall singular memories gives way to confusions and horror. It's the beginning of an eventual process where all memories begin to become more fluid through entanglements, repetition and rupture. \n\n02:08:53 - G1 - Stage 4 Post Awareness Confusions\n02:31:02 - H1 - Stage 4 Post Awareness Confusions\n02:52:55 - I1 - Stage 4 Temporary Bliss State \n03:13:58 - J1 - Stage 4 Post Awareness Confusions\n\nSTAGE 5 : 03:36:12\nPost-Awareness Stage 5 confusions and horror. More extreme entanglements, repetition and rupture can give way to calmer moments. The unfamiliar may sound and feel familiar. \nTime is often spent only in the moment leading to isolation.\n\n03:36:12 - K1 - Stage 5 Advanced plaque entanglements\n03:58:49 - L1 - Stage 5 Advanced plaque entanglements\n04:21:37 - M1 - Stage 5 Synapse retrogenesis\n04:42:25 - N1 - Stage 5 Sudden time regression into isolation\n\nSTAGE 6 : 05:04:32\nPost-Awareness Stage 6 is without description.\n\n05:04:32 - O1 - Stage 6 A confusion so thick you forget forgetting\n05:26:25 - P1 - Stage 6 A brutal bliss beyond this empty defeat\n05:48:02 - Q1 - Stage 6 Long decline is over\n06:09:12 - R1 - Stage 6 Place in the World fades away",

        "description": "All of our films, teachings and guided meditations are available for free at http://www.awakentheworld.com \n\nDo you find our films valuable? Please consider becoming a patron and support us at http://www.patreon.com/awakentheworld. Or make a one-time donation at http://www.paypal.me/samadhicenter.\n\n It is only through deep inquiry into the self that one will truly understand what the films point towards. \nWe created some resources for participants of the meditation retreats at the Samadhi Center (http://www.samadhi.ca) and decided that others may also find them helpful. Whether you are getting started in meditation, or you are interested in deepening your meditation practice, this series of guided meditations is designed to cultivate the concentration and equanimity needed to realize Samadhi. The parts are not separate meditation techniques, but part of one evolving, continuously deepening practice of observing the breath. Traditionally Samadhi is realized through deep meditation. If you want to realize Samadhi it is necessary to move beyond intellectual understanding to direct experience. \n\nIn this series of guided meditations, it is important to have the correct relationship to the instructions in the guided meditation.  The meditative technique of focusing on the breath must be understood as simply a way to divert energy from the mind, and to bring consciousness deep into the unconscious aspects of your being. The technique is not something to add to your mind or self structure. Any technique is a \"thorn to remove a thorn\", so you must be willing to let it go once it has served its purpose. As you move closer to Samadhi there is less mind, less technique, and less self, until there is a cessation of all activities of the self structure. This cessation of self is Samadhi, and in that stillness the dawning of wisdom or prajna is possible.\n\nPlease donate to the \"Awaken the World\" initiative so we can bring more great films and media productions to the world for free: https://www.paypal.me/SamadhiCenter\nWe rely on and appreciate your support!",

        "description": "Watch Jacob Collier play \"Make Me Cry\", \"Feel\", \"It Don't Matter\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nMore from NPR Music: \nTiny Desk Concerts: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nJuly 22, 2019 | Collin Marshall -- As the the NPR staff gathered to watch his performance, Jacob Collier sprinted full bore down the hallway. It seems the North London 24-year-old can hardly contain his creative energy. It comes out in his wardrobe and most definitely in his music, but it's not misdirected or out of control. These are intricate and precise compositions, like a ship in a bottle made of thousands of planks of wood, yet light enough to sail in a breeze. It's on a scale you wouldn't imagine. Here's an example: This year he covered Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" by recording himself 5,000 times and working in 144 other vocal submissions, and then he printed and sold signed copies of his Logic Pro audio session for fans while on tour. Though this is is a regular day for Jacob, his output continues to astonish everyone around him, both in its quality and sheer quantity. This year alone, he's putting out a project called Djesse with four distinct and complete volumes. Many of the songs are being written along the way, including one crafted specifically for the Tiny Desk called \"It Don't Matter.\"\n\nThe whole Tiny Desk Concert has a lot to unpack. Check my math, but by my count Jacob plays seven instruments, if you include his singing. And you should \u2014 Jacob's stamp has always been to use voice in his compositions like a Swiss army knife, and virtually every combination of band members harmonizes at some point in the show. It's reflective of his philosophy on music as a connecting tool, to use the instrument we all possess, which drew me to his art in the first place. And as if to make good on those beliefs and bring all of us into one moment, he invited the crowd to sing the final lyrics of the concert together. It was the end of the show, but not even close to the limit of Jacob's imaginative bounds. He obsessed over leaving us a gift: a fake ID fashioned out of a passport photo and an Oyster Card \u2014 London's public transit fare card \u2014 which now sits on the hallowed shelves of the Tiny Desk. Extra credit if you can spot it in future episodes.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Make Me Cry\"\n\"Feel\"\n\"It Don't Matter\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJacob Collier: vocals, piano, guitar, bass, melodica, cymbal; Becca Stevens: vocals, acoustic guitar, charango; Christian Euman: vocals, drums, percussion; MARO: vocals, acoustic guitar, keys; Robin Mullarkey: vocals, bass, percussion\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Colin Marshall, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Beck Harlan; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Paul Georgoulis; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR",

        "description": "Elevator Hacking - From the Pit to the Penthouse \nDeviant Ollam The CORE Group \nHoward Payne The CORE Group\n\nThroughout the history of hacker culture, elevators have played a key role. From the mystique of students at MIT taking late-night rides upon car tops (don't do that, please!) to the work of modern pen testers who use elevators to bypass building security systems (it's easier than you think!) these devices are often misunderstood and their full range of features and abilities go unexplored. This talk will be an in-depth explanation of how elevators work... allowing for greater understanding, system optimizing, and the subversion of security in many facilities. Those who attend will learn why an elevator is virtually no different than an unlocked staircase as far as building security is concerned!\n\nWhile paying the bills as a security auditor and penetration testing consultant with his company, The CORE Group, Deviant Ollam is also member of the Board of Directors of the US division of TOOOL, The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers. Deviant runs the Lockpicking Village with TOOOL at HOPE, DEFCON, ShmooCon, etc, and he has conducted physical security training sessions for Black Hat, DeepSec, ToorCon, HackCon, ShakaCon, HackInTheBox, ekoparty, AusCERT, GovCERT, CONFidence, the United States Military Academy at West Point, and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. His favorite Amendments to the US Constitution are, in no particular order, the 1st, 2nd, 9th, & 10th.\n\nTwitter: @deviantollam, @TCGsec\n\nHoward Payne is an elevator consultant from New York specializing in code compliance and accident investigations. He has logged over 9,000 hours examining car-tops, motor rooms, and hoistways in cases ranging from minor injuries to highly-publicized fatalities, and has contributed to forensic investigations that have been recognized by local, State, and Federal courts. Howard has appeared on national broadcast television making elevators do things they never should. When he's not riding up and down high-rise hoistways, he moonlights as a drum and bass DJ and semi-professional gambler. His favorite direction is Up and his favorite elevator feature is riot mode.\n\nTwitter: @SgtHowardPayne",

Your vendor has assured you how it will resist attack and how difficult it would be for someone to copy your key. Maybe they\u2019re right. But\u2026 the bulk of attacks that both penetration testers and also criminals attempt against doors have little or nothing to do with the lock itself! This talk will be a hard-hitting exploration (full of photo and video examples) of the ways in which your door \u2014 the most fundamental part of your physical security \u2014 can possibly be thwarted by someone attempting illicit entry. The scary problems will be immediately followed by simple solutions that are instantly implementable and usually very within-budget. You, too, can have a near-perfect door\u2026 if you\u2019re willing to learn and understand the problems that all doors tend to have.",

        "description": "Evan Sayet\n\nThe Language of Liberalism\n\nIf you think \"funny conservative\" is a contradiction in terms, then you've got to see Evan Sayet in action. Hilarious and thoughtful at the same time, he skewers the progressive left with the brutal, inconvenient truth. Mr. Sayet will have you laughing at the absurdity of modern \"liberal logic\"...which, come to think of it, is the real contradiction in terms.\n\nMr. Sayet splits his time between two distinct lines of commentary. Half the time he's America's leading conservative political comedian, leaving audiences in stitches at such venues as CPAC and David Horowitz's Restoration Weekend.\n\nWith the other half of his time, he soberly dissects the modern Liberal mind. He explores the reasons why their ideology leads them to ignore facts, reject reason, and ultimately side with evil over good, wrong instead of right, and behaviors that lead to failure rather than success.\n\nIn between, he's found time to write a bestselling book, The Kindergarten Eden: How the Modern Liberal Thinks.\n\nMr. Sayet manages to retain his sense of humor even though he spends so much of his time dealing with the frustrating, reality-denying, failure-preferring Liberal mindset.",

In this talk I want to show the contrary; that restraint and precision are usually better than power and flexibility. A constraint on component design leads to freedom and power when putting those components together into systems.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this feature is built into the very nature of language and reasoning.",

        "description": "\"To go on the journey of Self-realization, which is an inward journey, one must go completely alone. There are no companions on the road to Self-realization. It is only that willingness to enter into the realm of absolute aloneness, that enables the journey to even be possible.\"\n\n-\n\nIf you enjoyed this video please click the like button and subscribe to our channel for more spiritual wisdom from Shunyamurti. \n\nNEWSLETTER: For the latest Shunyamurti teachings subscribe to our free newsletter: http://bit.ly/2sa1pJh\n\nMEMBERS SECTION: An online portal to the more advanced teachings of Shunyamurti: https://www.satyoga.org/spiritual-teachings\n\nABOUT SHUNYAMURTI: Shunyamurti\u2019s life-long quest for truth and the power of healing our souls and our world has brought about a deep understanding of the dynamics of the traumatized ego, the karmic trajectory and wounds of the soul, and the radiant healing power of the Supreme Real that is the One Self. He has learned how to work on all levels simultaneously to help sustain the ecstasy of Self-realization. Many years of meditation practice and training in numerous forms of yoga, including apprenticeship with Baba Hari Dass, ten years of vowed association with a Brahmachari ashram in India, a special resonance with Sri Ramana Maharshi and a deep study of Advaita and esoteric Shaivism and Buddhism, have been supplemented by the intensive study of western metaphysics, modern sciences, profound exploration of the dimensions opened by entheogens, trans-personal psychology, various forms of psychoanalysis and Jungian dreamwork, and the entire development of the perennial philosophy, including Taoism, Kabbalah, and mystical Christianity. Shunyamurti now functions as spiritual guide, retreat leader, and teacher of the Sat Yoga Ashram and Community, in addition to his ongoing advanced research in the Yogic sciences. https://www.satyoga.org/shunyamurti  \n\nJOIN SHUNYAMURTI: Visit our website for more information about joining Shunyamurti for a retreat, Meditation Weekend, or Immersion Program at the Sat Yoga Ashram, Costa Rica \n\nFOLLOW US ONLINE \nWebsite: https://www.satyoga.org/ \nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/satyogainstitute\nInstagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/satyogaashram\nSpotify:\u00a0https://open.spotify.com/show/135j7XjUoaTOn1cCTWcBJS\niTunes:\u00a0https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spiritual-teachings-with-shunyamurti/id312136041?mt=2\nPodbean:\u00a0http://satyoga.podbean.com/\n\n[To All Who Listen to Shunyamurti\u2019s Teachings: Thank you all for your serious consideration of these ideas, which are intended to help you live a more coherent, peaceful, creative, compassionate, and productive life, and to be of service to the welfare of our world. We understand that our approach to existential concerns is not for everyone. We honor your right to disagree with these ideas and to stop listening if you do not like them. We gladly post comments with disagreements, if they are stated in a positive and mature manner, that allows civilized discourse about your own contrary ideas, and which may spark further useful and profound thought about the important issues that the teachings raise. If there are sincere questions about the teachings, or misunderstandings that can be clarified, Shunyamurti is always ready and willing to respond with helpful elaborations and even to cite texts and other authors whose writings may be of assistance to serious seekers. But comments that are simply angry and insulting, immature and unreasonable, will be removed because they undermine the educational and inspirational purpose of this project. Those who have questions that are more personal should write us in a private email and one of the teachers in our wisdom school will respond in the same way, or if the question is a very subtle or difficult one and requires a response from Shunyamurti, we will forward it to him on your behalf, and when he can, he will respond personally. By the way, we want to clarify that these teachings are new, they are not simply a repetition of old traditional teachings, but integrate current thought in the sciences, psychology, cultural studies, and philosophy. Shunyamurti speaks from his own realizations and deep clinical experience as a healer.] \n\n#satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening #karma #meditation #yoga #satyoga #ego",

        "title": "Lambda Jam 2015 - Conal Elliott - Denotational Design: From Meanings To Programs #YOWLambdaJam",
        "description": "In this talk, I\u2019ll share a methodology that I have applied many times over the last 20+ years when designing high-level libraries for functional programming. Functional libraries are usually organized around small collections of domain-specific data types together with operations for forming and combining values of those types. When done well, the result has the elegance and precision of algebra on numbers while capturing much larger and more interesting ideas.\n\nA library has two aspects with which all programmers are familiar: the programming interface (API) and its implementation. We want the implementation to be efficient and correct, since it\u2019s (usually) not enough to select arbitrary code for the implementation. To get clear about what constitutes correctness, and avoid fooling ourselves with vague, hand-waving statements, we\u2019ll want a precise specification, independent of any implementation. Fortunately, there is an elegant means of specification available to functional programmers: give a (preferably simple) mathematical meaning (model) for the types provided by a library, and then define each operation as if it worked on meanings rather than on representations. This practice, which goes by the fancy name of \u201cdenotational semantics\u201d (invented to explain programming languages rigorously), is very like functional programming itself, and so can be easily assimilated by functional programmers.\n\nRather than using semantics to explain an existing library (or language), we can instead use it to design one. It is often much easier and more enlightening to define a denotation than an implementation, because it does not have any constraints or distractions of efficiency, or even of executability. As an example, this style gave rise to Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), in which the semantic model of \u201cbehaviors\u201d (dynamic values) was simply functions of infinite, continuous time. Similarly, the Pan system applies this same idea to space instead of time, defining the semantics of an \u201cimage\u201d to be a function over infinite, continuous 2D space. Such meanings effectively and precisely capture the essence of a library\u2019s intent without the distraction of operational details. By doing so, these meanings offer library users a simpler but precise understanding of a library, while giving library developers an unambiguous definition of exactly what specification they must implement, while leaving a great deal of room for creativity about how. I call this methodology \u201cDenotational Design\u201d, because it is design focused on meaning (denotation).\n\nThe workshop will present the principles and practice of Denotational Design through examples. I will use Haskell, where purity and type classes are especially useful to guide the process. Once understood, the techniques are transferable to other functional languages as well. If you\u2019d like a sneak peak, see the paper Denotational design with type class morphisms and some related blog articles.\n\nConal Elliott has been working (and playing) in functional programming for more than 30 years. He especially enjoys applying semantic elegance and rigor to library design and optimized implementation. He invented the paradigm now known as \u201cfunctional reactive programming\u201d in the early 1990s, and then pioneered compilation techniques for high-performance, high-level embedded domain-specific languages, with applications including 2D and 3D computer graphics. The latter work included the first compilation of Haskell programs to GPU code, while maintaining precise and simple semantics and powerful composability, as well a high degree of optimization. Conal earned a BA in math with honors from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara in 1982 and a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1990. His latest position was at Tabula Inc, where he worked on chip specification and compiling Haskell to hardware for massively parallel execution until their closure in early 2015. Before Tabula, his positions included Architect at Sun Microsystems and Researcher in the Microsoft Research graphics group. He has also coached couples and led conscious relationship workshops together with his partner Holly Croydon, with whom he now lives on 20 acres in the woods in the California Gold Country.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com",

Today, truth is buried under soundbites and spin, and seeing clearly is more important than ever. In this talk, Eugenia Cheng will show how anyone can think like a mathematician to understand what people are really telling us \u2013 and how we can argue back. Taking a careful scalpel to fake news, politics, privilege, sexism and dozens of other real-world situations, she will teach us how to find clarity without losing nuance.\n\nWatch the Q&A: https://youtu.be/dp8wS0OZAK0\n\nEugenia Cheng is Scientist In Residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She won tenure in Pure Mathematics at the University of Sheffield, UK, where she is now Honorary Fellow. She has previously taught at the Universities of Cambridge, Chicago and Nice and holds a PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Cambridge. Alongside her research in Category Theory and undergraduate teaching, her aim is to rid the world of \u201cmath phobia\u201d. Her first popular math book, How to Bake Pi, was published by Basic Books in 2015 to widespread acclaim including from the New York Times, National Geographic, Scientific American, and she was interviewed around the world including on the BBC, NPR and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Her second book, Beyond Infinity, was shortlisted for the Royal Society Science Book Prize.\n\nThis talk and Q&A was filmed in the Ri on 2 July 2018.\n\n---\nA very special thank you to our Patreon supporters who help make these videos happen, especially:\nAlessandro Mecca, Ashok Bommisetti, Avrahaim Chein, bestape, Elizabeth Greasley, Greg Nagel, Lester Su, Rebecca Pan, Robert D Finrock, Roger Baker, Sergei Solovev and Will Knott.\n---\n\nThe Ri is on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheRoyalInstitution\nand Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_science\nand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http://ri-science.tumblr.com/\nOur editorial policy: http://www.rigb.org/home/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter\n\nProduct links on this page may be affiliate links which means it won't cost you any extra but we may earn a small commission if you decide to purchase through the link.",

It is the end result of 2 years of animating all chapters condensed for your viewing pleasure. Surely, you've heard the phrase \"Hate the game, not the player.\" I'm exposing the game and the players for you.\n\nBeing honest and speaking the truth has been a punishing and not at all rewarding experience, since most people will always shoot the messenger. I aim to raise awareness and arm the clueless for self-protection. I am not advocating becoming a manipulating and ruthless sociopath. \n\nI can't respect those who don't understand the difference. It's a self-improvement book, not the work of the devil. Robert Greene is all about intense realism. Seeing things for what they are, whether you like the truth or not. \n\nHopefully you'll find the video helpful, learn from it and share it with others. I've received plenty of messages from good people claiming it changed their lives for the better. \n\nDon't let others use and abuse you. Don't live in a fantasy land. Be cautious. Read this book or don't. It's up to you. \n\n___\nSubscribe \ud83d\udcaa http://bit.ly/illacertus\n\nBuy \"The 48 Laws of Power\" in the USA - http://amzn.to/1SRVIXS\nBuy \"The 48 Laws of Power\" in CA - http://amzn.to/1T2xKbd\nBuy \"The 48 Laws of Power\" in the UK - http://amzn.to/1q3UkpB\n\n___\nMusic | Ross Bugden\n\n___\nWatch my extended summary on the 48 Laws of Power - https://youtu.be/LLB4UrCXOq0",
