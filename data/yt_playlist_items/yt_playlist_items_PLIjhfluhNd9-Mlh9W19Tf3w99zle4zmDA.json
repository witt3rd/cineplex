        "description": "Join us for a whole week to learn online how to program robots with ROS.\nIn order to help students locked in their homes all around the world because of the COVID-19, we have prepared this 1-week free course so you can learn ROS during that time.\n \nStarting from zero, no ROS knowledge required, no Linux knowledge required, no Python knowledge required. You will learn all that throughout the week.\n\nSchedule:\n* DAY 1 Monday: Linux for Robotics. \n* DAY 2 Tuesday: Python for Robotics\n* DAY 3 Wednesday: ROS Basic concepts (packages, nodes, launches...)\n* DAY 4 Thursday: ROS topics (subscribers and publishers)\n* DAY 5 Friday: Program a robot to escape a maze\n\nJoin us in those live classes where you will be practicing with the teacher and ask him questions live.\n\nTeacher: Alberto Ezquerro, Head of Education at The Construct\n\nThis course is brought to you for free by The Construct (www.theconstruct.ai)\n\nThe whole code will be provided to all the attendants of the class. \n\n============================ \n* IMPORTANT: Remember to be on time for the class because at the beginning of the class, we will share the code with the attendants for free. \n* IMPORTANT 2: In order to start practicing quickly, we are using the ROS Development Studio. You will need a free account to attend the class. Go to http://rosds.online and create an account prior to the class. \n\n// RELATED LINKS \n\u25b8 ROS Development Studio: ( http://rosds.online ) \n\u25b8 Robot Ignite Academy: ( https://robotigniteacademy.com)\n\n#ROS #Robot #ROStutorials",

        "description": "Presentation for the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2021\n\nJulian Nubert, Shehryar Khattak and Marco Hutter\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05418.pdf\nCode: https://github.com/leggedrobotics/DeLORA\n\nAbstract:\nReliable robot pose estimation is a key building block of many robot autonomy pipelines, with LiDAR localization being an active research domain. In this work, a versatile self-supervised LiDAR odometry estimation method is presented, in order to enable the efficient utilization of all available LiDAR data while maintaining real-time performance. The proposed approach selectively applies geometric losses during training, being cognizant of the amount of information that can be extracted from scan points. In addition, no labeled or ground-truth data is required, hence making the presented approach suitable for pose estimation in applications where accurate ground-truth is difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the presented network architecture is applicable to a wide range of environments and sensor modalities without requiring any network or loss function adjustments. The proposed approach is thoroughly tested for both indoor and outdoor real-world applications through a variety of experiments using legged, tracked and wheeled robots, demonstrating the suitability of learning-based LiDAR odometry for complex robotic applications.",

I'm using an RPLidar A1 and just processing the data on an Arduino MEGA. It's a lot like having a 360' array of range finders but being able to pick out any angle to get the data. \n\nThe robot looks at the average distance in 360 10' segments, bookmarks the value, and then looks for any change - objects coming closer in any segment. If any objects are detected it turns to that segment using wheel encoders for positing and shoots the target.  I'd like to give it the ability to roam around looking for specific objects using the Jetson Nano for object recognition.\n\nVideos from the start:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrtz0a7HaQ4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WkocdmABTI\n\nCAD and Code is at: https://github.com/XRobots/LidarNerf\n\nYou can support me on Patreon or buy my Merchandise:\n***************************\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/xrobots\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/james-bruton\n***************************\n\nAffiliate links - I will get some money of you use them to sign up or buy something:\n***************************\nMatterhackers 3D printing supplies: http://www.matterhackers.com?aff=7500\nMusic for your YouTube videos: http://share.epidemicsound.com/xrobots\nAmazon US: https://www.amazon.com/?tag=xrobotsuk-20\nAmazon UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/?tag=xrobotsuk-21\nAmazon FR France: https://www.amazon.fr/?tag=xrobotsuk0c-21\nAmazon DE Germany: https://www.amazon.de/?tag=xrobotsuk02-21\nAmazon ES Spain: https://www.amazon.es/?tag=xrobotsuk07-21\nAmazon IT Italy: https://www.amazon.it/?tag=xrobotsuk08-21\n***************************\n\nOther socials:\n***************************\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/xrobotsuk\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/xrobotsuk/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/xrobotsuk \n***************************\n\nCAD and Code for my projects: https://github.com/XRobots\n\nHuge thanks to my Patrons, without whom my standard of living would drastically decline.

        "title": "Stepper Motors with Arduino - Controlling Bipolar & Unipolar stepper motors",
        "description": "Learn how to use stepper motors with the Arduino.\n\nFull Article with Code at https://dronebotworkshop.com/stepper-motors-with-arduino/\nMore articles and tutorials: https://dronebotworkshop.com\nJoin the conversation on the forum: https://forum.dronebotworkshop.com\nSubscribe to the newsletter and stay in touch: https://dronebotworkshop.com/subscribe/\n\nToday we will be working with stepper motors, a versatile yet often misunderstood electromechanical component used in a variety of devices. \n\nAfter examining how stepper motors work and what the difference is between a \u201cBipolar\u201d and \u201cUnipolar\u201d stepper is I will show you how three methods of controlling a stepper motor with an Arduino:\n \n1 - A common 28YBJ-48 Unipolar Stepper with a ULN2003 driver board. These inexpensive stepper and driver combinations are very common and are available on eBay, Amazon, and probably in your local electronics store.  I\u2019ll show you two different ways to use these with two different Arduino libraries.\n\n2 - A NEMA 17 Bipolar stepper motor with an L298N dual H-Bridge driver board. We\u2019ve used the L298N driver board in another video to control a pair of brushed DC motors but it also makes a good driver for a bipolar stepper motor.\n\n3 - The same NEMA 17 Bipolar stepper motor controlled by an A4988 stepper driver. This common driver board is used in many 3D printers and CNC machines and simplifies the control of one or several stepper motors with an Arduino.\n\nI\u2019ll also discuss concepts like microstepping and I will show you how to understand some of the many parameters that are included on stepper motor specification sheets.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to jump ahead to a particular section in the video here is the table of contents:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:34 - Stepper Motor Theory\n04:21 - Bipolar vs Unipolar Steppers\n08:18 - Common Stepper Specifications\n11:32 - NEMA motor sizes\n13:41 - 28YBJ-48 Unipolar Stepper with ULN2003\n28:16 - NEMA 17 Bipolar with L298N\n36:41 - NEMA 17 Bipolar with A4988\n\nAs always you can get all of the code I use in this video by visiting the DroneBot Workshop website and looking at the article at https://dbot.ws/stepper. You\u2019ll find code listings and hookup diagrams and well as a convenient ZIP file containing all of the Arduino sketches.\n\nHopefully, this video will inspire you to start using stepper motors in your own designs. \n\nNow let's get stepping!",

        "description": "This is the Drone programming with python course. Here we are going to learn the basics of a drone including the components and how the drone flies. Then we will look the installations and the basic movements along with image capture. From their we will create exciting projects including Surveillance drone , Face tracking and line following drone. \nIf you are a beginner don't worry this course is for you we will focus on the implementation part so that you can get most practical experience out of this. And even though we will be using a specific drone for this course 80% of the material covered in this course can be used with any drone. \n\nPremium Courses: \n\u2714\ufe0fAdvanced Drone Programming Course:\nhttps://www.computervision.zone/adv-drone-pro-lp/ \n\u2714\ufe0f Learn to Build Computer Vision Mobile Apps:\nhttps://www.computervision.zone/cv-mobile-app-lp/\n\u2714\ufe0f Jetson Nano Premium Course:\nhttps://www.computervision.zone/cv-jetson-nano-lp/\n\nBuy the Tello Drone:\nhttps://amzn.to/2t4l2pW \n\nDownload Code:\nhttps://www.computervision.zone/courses/drone-programming/\n\nShirts for Coders:\nhttps://bit.ly/3CEipcD\n\nFollow Me:\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/bFVMkzf  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/murtazasworkshop\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/murtazasworkshop/\nWebsite: https://www.computervision.zone/\nGithub: https://github.com/murtazahassan\nThingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/Murtaza_Hassan/\n\nProduct Links:\nJetson Nano: https://amzn.to/3eY3AWN \nCheap Drone for OpenCV: https://amzn.to/2TZpsJy\nDC Motors + Wheels + Chassis: https://amzn.to/2SCZon3\nDC Motors + Wheels: https://amzn.to/2QeEusw\nArduino UNO: https://amzn.to/2QdKthB\nMotor Driver: https://amzn.to/35grl6x\nBattery: https://amzn.to/2Fadc0c\nRecommend Webcam for Computer Vision: https://amzn.to/2MNtVKZ\nBudget Webcam: https://amzn.to/2ZP47Ug\nRaspberry Pi 4 Best Starter Kit:  https://amzn.to/2YVCEkL\nRaspberry Pi Recommended Battery: https://amzn.to/2C0I9pl\n\n#ComputerVision\n#OpenCV\n#Python\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 Intro\n1:00 What is a drone?\n2:14  Components of a drone\n05:56 How does a drone fly?\n08:42 Tello Drone\n11:25 App Setup and Test Run \n15:07 Installations\n19:21 Basic Movements\n31:16 Image Capture\n36:27 Keyboard Control\n59:13 Project 1 - Surveillance\n1:10:34 Project 2 - Mapping\n1:52:15 Project 3 - Face Tracking\n2:32:18 Project 4 - Line Follower",

        "description": "$2 for 5 PCBs, SMT Assembly fee $0. Order from https://jlcpcb.com/RHS\n\nThere are lots of great animatronic and robotics props and projects out there, and it's easy to make r/c servos and other actuators move using the Arduino servo library. This means that the servos stops and start very suddenly, moving as fast as they can between positions. In this video I'm going to show you two lines of very simple code to make things smoother.\n\nCAD and Code: https://github.com/XRobots/ServoSmoothing\n\nYou can support me on Patreon or buy my Merchandise:\n***************************\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/xrobots\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/james-bruton\n***************************\n\nAffiliate links - I will get some money of you use them to sign up or buy something:\n***************************\nMatterhackers 3D printing supplies: http://www.matterhackers.com?aff=7500\nMusic for your YouTube videos: http://share.epidemicsound.com/xrobots\n***************************\n\nOther socials:\n***************************\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/xrobotsuk\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/xrobotsuk/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/xrobotsuk \n***************************\n\nCAD and Code for my projects: https://github.com/XRobots\n\nHuge thanks to my Patrons, without whom my standard of living would drastically decline.
