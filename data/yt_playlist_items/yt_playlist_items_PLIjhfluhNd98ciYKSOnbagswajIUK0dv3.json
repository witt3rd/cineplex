However, if you are willing to donate, my PayPal address is rfgb@hotmail.ca. Even amounts as small as a dollar are big helps everyone, so thank you!\n\nThose of you who have been around a while, know that I love to push my limits as a composer by writing as diversely as I possibly can. Here\u2019s my next effort in that regard: 80s horror / scary music. The style has seen a bit of a comeback recently thanks to the brilliant score for It Follows, and more recently, the (fan-freaking-tastic) Netflix series \u2018Stranger Things\u2019. With Halloween season coming up, I couldn\u2019t resist having a go at it. This track is 100% my own original sound design (with the exception of the background radio tuning that comes in a few times), which made it even more challenging. However, immersing myself in the film and music of that period for the last month was absolutely wonderful, and I had loads of fun writing this track!  As always, I really hope you enjoy the results :) \n\nP.S. The title is an abbreviation of the saying \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes\u201d, similarly to how the Netflix show\u2019s title is an abbreviation of \u201cStranger Things Have Happened\u201d (I presume). Just throwing that out there because without that background info it just seems like the worlds least creative title lol.\n\nIF YOU EVER RECEIVE A CLAIM FOR USING MY FREE MUSIC, DISPUTE IT AND INFORM ME IMMEDIATELY. \n\nThis track is licensed under a \u2018Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License\u2019.

No need to get permission. There are only 3 rules:\n\n1) Credit me! In most cases this means posting a link to my channel or the video of the track you used. This takes about 10 seconds to do, while the track you\u2019re using probably took me hours and hours (and hours). Doing this helps me keep the music free :)\n\n2) You may NOT use my music in an audio track that you intend to put into the Content ID system. This will result in false claims given to people who use my music in their videos. These situations are illegal and have resulted in people being banned from networks etc. DON\u2019T DO IT.\n\n3) Subscribe to me! Okay, this one isn\u2019t really mandatory haha.

        "title": "Dukas: ''La P\u00e9ri,'' Fanfare To The Ballet (Orchestral)",
        "description": "Paul Abraham Dukas (1865 -- 1935) was a French composer, critic, scholar and teacher. A studious man, of retiring personality; he was intensely self-critical and he abandoned and destroyed many of his compositions. His best known work is the orchestral piece The Sorcerer's Apprentice (L'apprenti sorcier), the fame of which has eclipsed that of his other surviving works. Among these are an opera Ariane et Barbe-bleue, a symphony, two substantial works for solo piano, and a ballet, \"La P\u00e9ri.\"\n \nAt a time when French musicians were divided into conservative and progressive factions, Dukas adhered to neither but retained the admiration of both. His compositions were influenced by composers including Beethoven, Berlioz, Franck, d'Indy and Debussy.\n\nDukas's last major work was his sumptuous oriental ballet of 1912, \"La P\u00e9ri\" (\"The Peri, or The Flower of Immortality\"). Described by the composer as a \"po\u00e8me dans\u00e9\" it depicts a young Persian prince who travels to the ends of the Earth in a quest to find the lotus flower of immortality, coming across its guardian, the P\u00e9ri (fairy). \n\nBecause of the very quiet opening pages of the ballet score, the composer added a brief \"Fanfare pour pr\u00e9c\u00e9der La Peri\" (fanfare preceding the ballet) which gave the typically noisy audiences of the day, time to settle in their seats before the work proper began. \n\nI kept this true to the original brass instrumentation, however, added choir voices to enhance the majesty of the work. It has been a favorite piece of mine since first hearing it on Isao Tomita's 1986 live concert recording, \"Back To The Earth.\"",

        "title": "Albinoni-Giazotto: Adagio in G minor (Neo-Baroque Synthesized)",
        "description": "For information on the visualization, please read the note at the end.\n\nTomaso Albinoni (1671 \u2013 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer. His output includes operas, concertos, sonatas for one to six instruments, sinfonias, and solo cantatas. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is known today for his instrumental music, especially his concertos.\n\nBorn in Venice, the son of a wealthy paper merchant, he studied violin and singing. Relatively little is known about his life, which is surprising considering his contemporary stature as a composer, and the comparatively well-documented period in which he lived. Unlike most composers of his time, he appears never to have sought a post at either a church or noble court, but then he was a man of independent means \u2013 a composer who had a financially rather well-cushioned life, thanks to the shares he inherited in his father\u2019s stationery firm (which manufactured playing cards, among other things) and had the option to compose music independently. \n\n\u201cAlbinoni\u2019s Adagio\u201d is probably one of the most famous and recognizable pieces attributed to the Baroque period; widely familiar through its frequent use in film scores, TV and advertising. The work is slow of pace, solemn of mood, and frequently transcribed for various combinations of instruments in modern times. It has appeared on countless recordings of various Baroque classics\u2026 erroneously! In truth, this famed work is not by Albinoni at all. It is a mid-20th century \u201cneo-Baroque\" creation by Remo Giazotto (1910 \u2013 1998), an Italian musicologist, mostly known through his systematic cataloguing of the works of Tomaso Albinoni. He also wrote biographies of Albinoni and other composers, including Vivaldi.\n\nAccording to Giazotto, he obtained the document shortly after the end of World War II from the Saxon State Library in Dresden which had preserved most of its collection, though its buildings were destroyed in the bombing raids of February and March 1945 by the Allied Forces. Giazotto concluded that the manuscript fragment was a portion of a church sonata (sonata da chiesa, one of two standard forms of the trio sonata) in G minor composed by Albinoni, possibly as part of his Op. 4 set, around 1708.\n\nIn Giazotto\u2019s account, the fragment contained only the low-pitched supporting continuo part and a few phrases of the melody itself. From that meagre beginning, Giazotto fleshed out a complete single-movement composition according to established Baroque principles of the period, creating something generally in the style of a chaconne, in which a set of repeated pitches underlies an evolving melody. Although it is not, strictly speaking, an Albinoni composition, it does bear the characteristics of the Italian Baroque style, particularly in its overall structure.\n\nGiazotto copyrighted and published the work in 1958 (a little over 200 years after Albinoni\u2019s death) under a title which, translated into English, reads \"Adagio in G Minor for Strings and Organ, on Two Thematic Ideas and on a Figured Bass by Tomaso Albinoni.\" Giazotto never produced the manuscript fragment, and no official record has been found of its presence in the collection of the Saxon State Library. However, a discovery by musicologist Muska Mangano, Giazotto's last assistant before his death, has cast some doubt on that belief. Among Giazotto's papers, Mangano discovered a modern but independent manuscript transcription of the figured bass portion, and six fragmentary bars of the first violin, \"bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken.\" There was a continuing scholarly debate about whether the alleged fragment was real, or a musical hoax perpetrated by Giazotto, but there is no longer any doubt about Giazotto's authorship of the remainder of the work and Mangagno\u2019s findings provide support for Giazotto's account that he did base his composition on an earlier source.\n\nI adapted my originally-posted \"New Age\" electronic piece, this time using shimmering choir voices, ambient strings and combinations of other sounds to create \"pseudo-instruments\" with familiar orchestral qualities - all coming together in a hauntingly beautiful realization of the original score. There is definitely a nod to the late Japanese artist Isao Tomita here. Rather than this piece representing an overly-indulgent, bitter-sweet clich\u00e9, I wanted the listener to get lost in an ethereal dream; travelling through memories of joy, loss, past & present, culminating in hope for the future at the resolution.\n\nAs always, the use of headphones will greatly enhance the listening experience.\n\nFor those wishing to follow along with the MAMM (Music Animation Machine Midi) Player, the voicing is as follows:\n\nSolo Violin - Orange\nViolin I/Choir I - Yellow\nViolin II/Choir II - Yellow-Green\nViola/Choir III - Green\nCello/Double Bass - Violet\nCello/Bass Pizzicato - Blue\nOrgan - Coral-Pink \nOrgan Pedal - Rose-Pink",

        "title": "Ives: The Unanswered Question (Synthesized Orchestral)",
        "description": "Using headphones will enhance the listening experience. \n\nCharles Edward Ives (1874 \u2013 1954) was an American modernist composer. His music was largely ignored during his early life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. The quality of his music was publicly recognized later in his lifetime and he came to be regarded as an \"American original.\" He was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, and quarter tones. His experimentation foreshadowed many musical innovations that were later more widely adopted during the 20th century.\n\nIves composed \u201cThe Unanswered Question\u201d (subtitled \"a Cosmic Landscape\" in his work papers), in 1908. It was originally paired with \"Central Park in the Dark\" as \"Two Contemplations.\" He later revised it in 1930\u201335, where he included a 13-bar introduction, made the woodwind parts more dissonant, and added further dynamic and articulation indications. He also made a small but significant change to the \"question motif,\" which had originally ended on the note that began it (b-flat), but now remains unresolved (b-natural). As with many of Ives' works, it was largely unknown until much later in his life. Though not performed until 1946, it continues to fascinate and capture the imagination of composers and audiences today.\n\nIves provided a short text by which to interpret the work, giving it a narrative as in program music. Throughout the piece the strings sustain slow tonal triads that represent \"The Silence of the Druids \u2013 who Know, See and Hear Nothing.\" Against this background, the trumpet poses a non-tonal phrase \u2013 \"The Perennial Question of Existence\" \u2013 7 times, to which the woodwinds \"answer\" only 6 in an increasingly erratic way. Ives wrote that the woodwinds represented \"Fighting Answerers\" who, after a time, realize a futility and begin to mock \"The Question\" before finally disappearing, leaving \"The Question\" to be asked once more before \"The Silences\" are left to their \"Undisturbed Solitude.\" The piece ends with the strings humming softly in the distance, like the eternal music of the spheres.\n\nMusically speaking, the strings twice repeat a very soft 13-bar progression, so slowly it feels static. Voice leading and passing tones are used in a manner reminiscent of a hymn. After the repetition, the strings\u2019 part varies in subtle ways that are not easily apparent. In contrast to this changing but seemingly regular \"Silence,\" the trumpet repeats the same \"Question.\" It is the woodwinds' atonal \u201cAnswers\u201d that change in obvious ways, growing increasingly agitated and dissonant. After they finally give up, the trumpet poses the \u201cQuestion\u201d quietly one last time, and the \u201cSilences\u201d are heard beyond in \u201cUndisturbed Solitude,\" prolonging their pure G major triad into eternity. \n\nThe work\u2019s metaphorical meaning can be transmitted quite successfully as the piece is a Masterclass in orchestration, specifically in stratification between orchestral layers (strings, trumpet & woodwinds). The groups perform at independent tempos and are placed separately on the stage \u2013 ideally with the strings offstage. The stratified linear events pan out within the music taking into consideration basically all musical parameters including timbre, register, dynamics, tonality, harmony, melodic structure, rhythmic profile, etc. to reflect the idea that the question, though coexisting with the answer, bears no relationship with it. Ives makes a deep philosophical statement about this work, claiming \u201cin the immensity of creation, a question speaks louder than the answer.\u201d Ives believed that the human spirit evolved with the ever-growing realm of nature. Music play\u2019s a prominent role in any journey and this brings depth and substance to human life. \"The Unanswered Question\" reflects this universal \"religion\" that Ives was himself exploring. \n\nI first heard the piece on Tomita\u2019s \u201cKosmos\u201d of 1978. His interpretation was space oriented and heavily laden with effects. My take is similarly inspired, though only the \u201cintro\u201d & \u201coutro\u201d set and complete the scene; it\u2019s more about the music and its story. Metaphorically, what if the strings represent the vastness of \u201cthe Cosmos,\u201d the trumpet asks \u201cthe Question: is anyone out there?\u201d while \u201cthe Answerers\u201d represent other beings who receive the signal but can\u2019t interpret it \u2013 eventually giving up, mocking \u201cthe Question\u201d in frustration. The Universe continues to expand into eternity while the 7th signal is sent out into the \u201cUnknown Silence.\u201d\n\nIn terms of my process, 11 layers of strings are used, each panning across the stereo vista. While the upper voicing shimmers to create the vastness of space, the lower strings ground the piece to set the cosmic plane. The trumpet has a subtle digital delay added which helps to nondescriptly echo the question. The 4 flutes are less ethereal and audibly retain their individual presence on the sound stage.",

Re-Visited: 17/06/2018. \nThis video was originally released last year, but was blocked worldwide a month later. So, to prevent this from being taken down, I just sped the blocked footage up, along with changing the brightness/contrast! Anyways, nothing much to say here, but huge thanks to NitroG for suggesting this idea to me to reupload it and add some other features to it! This also took 5 hours to process and 3 hours to upload too, so this was quite a pain to upload. So, hope you enjoy this lengthy video and try and not skip them! C: \n\n-TR3X",
