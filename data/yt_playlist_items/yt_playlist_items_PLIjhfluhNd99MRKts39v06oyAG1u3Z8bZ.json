Note that each individual pentomino can contain 0, 1 or 2 stars, as long as the total number of stars within all pentominoes of its type is exactly 2.\n\nYou can find a picture of all 12 pentominoes here:\nhttps://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00049Q\n\n\u25b6  SIMON VS PHISTOMEFEL \u25c0\nIf you'd like to try the Phistomefel's Yin-Yang Fillomino, you can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/49gg9R9jT6\n\nRules and example puzzle can be found here:\nhttps://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00053V\n\nA (long) video of Simon doing battle with this puzzle is out now on Patreon.\n\nPlease follow us on Twitter: @crypticcracking\n\n**************************************************************\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW KILLER SUDOKU APP IS OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS\u25c0\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/killer-sudoku-ctc/id1544165118\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1471910/Killer_Sudoku/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.KillerSudoku&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n\u25b6  SIMON REACTION BOARD (!) \u25c0\nWith thanks to Andrea for creating this :)\nhttps://simonreacts.avris.it/\n\n\u25b6 OUR MIRACLE SUDOKU APP IS OUT \u25c0\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377260/Miracle_Sudoku/\nApp Store:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527363795\nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.MiracleSudokuCTC\n\n\u25b6 CTC FAN DISCORD SERVER\u25c0\nhttps://discord.gg/BbN89j5\n\nNEW:  Guide To Our Discord Server:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCDiscordGuide\n\n\u25b6 OUR BACK CATALOGUE \u2013 ALL CATEGORISED WITH LINKS!\u25c0\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCCatalogue\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW THERMO SUDOKU APP IS OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thermo-sudoku/id1513994223  \nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ThermoSudoku\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1316390/Thermo_Sudoku/  \n\n\u25b6 *NEW* CRACKING THE CRYPTIC MERCHANDISE\u25c0 \nhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/cracking-the-cryptic\n\n\u25b6 OUR CHESS SUDOKU APP IS NOW OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-sudoku/id1500654482?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250560/Chess_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ChessSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR CLASSIC SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/classic-sudoku/id1488838275?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188330/Classic_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ClassicSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR SANDWICH SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandwich-sudoku/id1476116705?ls=1 \nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117310/Sandwich_Sudoku/  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.SandwichSudoku\n\n\u25b6SEND US PUZZLES TO SOLVE/CONTACT US\u25c0\ncrackingthecryptic@gmail.com\n\n\u25b6FOLLOW US\u25c0\nTwitter: #crypticcracking \n@crypticcracking\nInstagram (for how to solve daily clues from The Times): https://www.instagram.com/crackingthecryptic/?hl=en\n\n\u25b6SOFTWARE\u25c0\nPlay the puzzle in the video by clicking the link under the video (above).

In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage.  Digits may not repeat along each of the marked diagonals.

A \"taxicab\" distance from cell A to cell B is the minimum possible distance from cell A to cell B when traversed only through orthogonal cells.

Can you unlock the secrets of the ancient world?!!  \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nToday's puzzle has been recommended to us several times over the last few days.  It's called The Tree and it marks a debut on the channel for the setter Garford.  This is a weird and wonderful sudoku and you can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/6tnBLrmPgh\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. The tree branches are populated by 2-digit numbers where the tens digit is placed before the units digit seen from the stem (ie the bulb in box 8) - in other words, tens and units digits are alternating along the lines.  The bulb includes the first number, read from left to right. The 2-digit numbers must increase along the branches. When a branch separates, the 2-digit numbers on all new branches must be greater than the 2-digit number on the preceding \"parent branch\". The 2-digit numbers must not repeat across the whole tree.\n\nIf you'd like to try the Phistomefel Yin-Yang Fillomino mentioned in the introduction to the video, you can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/49gg9R9jT6\n\nRules and example puzzle can be found here:\nhttps://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00053V\n\nPlease follow us on Twitter: @crypticcracking\n\n**************************************************************\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW KILLER SUDOKU APP IS OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS\u25c0\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/killer-sudoku-ctc/id1544165118\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1471910/Killer_Sudoku/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.KillerSudoku&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n\u25b6  SIMON REACTION BOARD (!) \u25c0\nWith thanks to Andrea for creating this :)\nhttps://simonreacts.avris.it/\n\n\u25b6 OUR MIRACLE SUDOKU APP IS OUT \u25c0\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377260/Miracle_Sudoku/\nApp Store:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527363795\nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.MiracleSudokuCTC\n\n\u25b6 CTC FAN DISCORD SERVER\u25c0\nhttps://discord.gg/BbN89j5\n\nNEW:  Guide To Our Discord Server:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCDiscordGuide\n\n\u25b6 OUR BACK CATALOGUE \u2013 ALL CATEGORISED WITH LINKS!\u25c0\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCCatalogue\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW THERMO SUDOKU APP IS OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thermo-sudoku/id1513994223  \nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ThermoSudoku\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1316390/Thermo_Sudoku/  \n\n\u25b6 *NEW* CRACKING THE CRYPTIC MERCHANDISE\u25c0 \nhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/cracking-the-cryptic\n\n\u25b6 OUR CHESS SUDOKU APP IS NOW OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-sudoku/id1500654482?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250560/Chess_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ChessSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR CLASSIC SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/classic-sudoku/id1488838275?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188330/Classic_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ClassicSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR SANDWICH SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandwich-sudoku/id1476116705?ls=1 \nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117310/Sandwich_Sudoku/  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.SandwichSudoku\n\n\u25b6SEND US PUZZLES TO SOLVE/CONTACT US\u25c0\ncrackingthecryptic@gmail.com\n\n\u25b6FOLLOW US\u25c0\nTwitter: #crypticcracking \n@crypticcracking\nInstagram (for how to solve daily clues from The Times): https://www.instagram.com/crackingthecryptic/?hl=en\n\n\u25b6SOFTWARE\u25c0\nPlay the puzzle in the video by clicking the link under the video (above).

        "description": "*** Today's Sudoku***\n\nAnd now for something a bit different!  Today's puzzle, which is by Hraf, uses the real geography of the Wirral Peninsula in just a wonderful sudoku that's dedicated to Hraf's grandparents:\n\n\"This puzzle is dedicated to my grandparents who are from Liverpool:\nMy grandfather, who passed earlier this year; but especially to my\ngrandmother, who taught me from a young age to love puzzles and encouraged my curiosity about the world.\"\n\nYou can play it at the link below: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/GMmTTqFhp2\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. The blue areas represent the water surrounding the Wirral Peninsula. The green areas are land. On land, the digit in a cell represents the height of a skyscraper built in that cell. No skyscrapers can be built on water, so any digit can appear on water without affecting sightlines. Sightlines to a shorter building are blocked by taller buildings. The cages represent places where photographs were taken by a photographer on a boat cruise. The small arrow in a cage represents the direction the photographer was facing. Additionally, the digit given in the cage represents the number of skyscrapers visible in the given direction. In places where multiple photographs were taken, all of the photographs will be clued in the same cage. The digit in the cell with a grey square is even. Note: Because no skyscrapers are built on water, no digits in those cells block sightline to any land which may be across the water from the photographer.\n\n*** Join The Best Sudoku Club On Earth ***\nIf you'd like to try jovi_al's Negativity - an amazing new classic sudoku - then you can at the following link:\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/mdtTb9qmhp\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. \n\nThere is a bonus video on Patreon right now on how to solve this puzzle!  \n(As well as December's monthly reward!!)\n\nYou can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month here:  \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n\u25b6 SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  \u25c0\n\nIt's OUT on Windows (released yesterday!) via Steam here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1706870/Svens_SudokuPad/\n\nYou can now input your own classic sudoku puzzles into our software using our new App!

        "description": "*** Today's Sudoku***\n\nWe love innovations in sudoku and ZegreS' idea to make sudokus that are hybrids with famous riddles tickles us pink.  We did one of these a couple of weeks ago and here's another one!  This time it borrows from a famous riddle in The Lady Or The Tiger by Raymond Smullyan.  Who would be the reward behind the door if you had a choice?  If we get enough replies we'll reveal our most desired party guests X)\n\nYou can play it at the link below: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/6nb6Ndf63L\n\nRules: \nRiddle part:\nA lovably eccentric king has put before you a test. Choose one of three doors and encounter either: a lady (represented by the digit 1) who is the life and soul of a party or a tiger (represented by the digit 9) struggling with intermittent fasting. Behind two doors (in the cage) is a tiger (9) and no lady (1). Behind one door (in the cage) is a lady (1) and no tiger (9).  Signs hang above each door: Above Room 1: A tiger is in room 2.

        "description": "Today's puzzle is called Quorum Rings and it's another of these sudokus that seems to defy belief.  It's a debut on the channel for Jay Dyer and you'll want to be having a go at this one!  \n\nYou can play the puzzle at the following link: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/H8JHPgbjtj\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. Digits may not repeat on either main diagonal (marked in blue). In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage.  Digits cannot repeat within a cage. The clue outside the grid gives the sum of the digits on the indicated diagonal.  Digits may repeat along this diagonal if allowed by other rules.\n\n*** Two Truths And A Lie by zetamath ***\nThis puzzle is incredible, one of the best we've ever seen.  But it does contain an enormous ruleset - especially if the rules are fully explained.  Give the puzzle a try on the link below and watch out for Simon's video on how to solve it.  The video is available now on Patreon tonight and will appear on the channel in the coming days.\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/NFhHj2bQ2g\n\n*** Our Patreon - The Best Sudoku Club In The World *** \nYou can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month and access a lot of extra content.

The app also comes with 12 handmade puzzles from us and we're also releasing occasional bonus puzzles too.  Already available on IOS and Android.\n\n*** Today's Sudoku ***\n\nToday's sudoku is the 5th puzzle in a series of \"Build Your Own\" from the wonderful Joseph Nehme.  It's incredible how much can be done with just these small changes to the rules we know and love. This is definitely an approachable sudoku (genuinely!) so do give it a try if you have the time. Play the puzzle at the following link:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/JH8hqjFfD9\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage.  Digits cannot repeat within a cage. The cages themselves must be deduced; each cage contains a \"renban\" that spans ALL of its cells.  The line must start at the killer cage sum clue and move horizontally and vertically through cells (but not diagonally).  The line must not branch.  NB As usual, the killer cage total must always be in the upper left corner of the cage (uppermost prioritised over leftmost). Cells connected by a \"renban\" line must contain consecutive digits in any order.  Cages may not overlap.\n\n*** More Patreon Content ***\nSimon released a video on Patreon last week where he attempts the first 8 puzzles from the new Genuinely Approachable Pencil Puzzle series on Discord.

        "description": "\u25b6 SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  \u25c0\n\nIt's just OUT on Windows via Steam here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1706870/Svens_SudokuPad/\n\nYou can now input your own classic sudoku puzzles into our software using our new App!  The app also comes with 12 handmade puzzles from us and we're also releasing occasional bonus puzzles too.  Already available on IOS and Android.\n\n*** Today's Sudoku ***\n\nThis is an awesome take on the \"Squid Game\" Red Light Green Light from the Netflix series from Piatato.  It's such a clever implementation of the idea and SO much fun to solve.  Play the puzzle at the following link:\nVersion with flavour text rules: https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/8jPnpjrnr6\n\nVersion with plain rules:\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/hnrnDL7Q8L\n\nRules (flavour text version):\nNormal sudoku rules apply.  In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage (if given).  Digits cannot repeat within a cage. The solver must run along an orthogonally connected path that starts and ends in the green cells. While on a green light, the solver must run as fast as they can and while on a red light they must try not to move. Speed is represented by the value of the digits! The solver is on a green light as long as the path goes on cells that aren't part of a killer cage. On these green cells the solver must keep up speed thus these cells must all contain high digits (6 or higher).  If the path crosses a killer cage, the solver has got a red light.  Here the solver must stay as still as they can in order not to be killed thus the red cells must contain low digits (4 or lower).  The path does not touch itself orthogonally or diagonally.\n\nRules (plain version):\nNormal sudoku rules apply.  In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage (if given).  Digits cannot repeat within a cage. Find an orthogonally connected path that starts and ends in the green cells. Digits on the path that are inside killer cages must be low (4 or lower); cells on the path that are outside of killer cages must be high (6 or higher). The path does not touch itself orthogonally or diagonally.\n\n*** More Patreon Content ***\nSimon released a video on Patreon last week where he attempts the first 8 puzzles from the new Genuinely Approachable Pencil Puzzle series on Discord.

        "description": "***Thanks to everyone who helped with our Google PlayStore issue.  Our Thermo Sudoku and Miracle Sudoku apps will be reinstated shortly.  Hooray! ***\n\nIn today's puzzle we have to make our way through the graveyard!  This puzzle is proving incredibly popular.  It's by fjam and you'll love it!  You can play the Graveyard Of Ideas at the following link: \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/graveyardofideas\n\nRules: \nNormal Sudoku rules apply. In graves (cages), digits must sum to the day, month or year of the date on the grave. Digits cannot repeat within graves. Escape the graveyard by carefully plotting an orthogonally connected path between the green and red cells. The path may not cross the highest or lowest digits in a grave. \n\n*** Botaku Bonus Puzzle *** \nAs mentioned in the video, we have a bonus puzzle today from the brilliant Botaku.  It's called Euclidean Sudoku!  You can play it at the link below and watch a video of Simon solving it on our Patreon page.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\nPlay the puzzle here:\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/tMmgPBBP93\nSudokuPad link: https://tinyurl.com/4t74y7rs\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. Given two cells which both contain the digit N, the Euclidean distance between (the centres of) those cells must be at least \u221aN times the sidelength of a single cell. In other words, if moving from one such cell to the other takes X horizontal steps and Y  vertical steps, then \u221a(X^2 + Y^2) \u2265 \u221aN. \n\n\u25b6 SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  \u25c0\nYou can now input your own classic sudoku puzzles into our software using our new App!

Digits in column 1 indicate the column in which the digit 1 appears in that row (eg if r4c1 is a 6, r4c6 is a 1).  The same is true of column 5 and the digit 5, and column 9 and the digit 9.\n\n*** Our Patreon - The Best Sudoku Club In The World *** \nYou can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month and access a lot of extra content.  Recent Patreon specials include Simon solving a Botaku sudoku (Euclidean Sudoku), the Lockout Lines Sudoku Hunt and Mark solving ridiculously hard cryptic crosswords.

It's by tenaliraman and you can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/6GN92JG8H9\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply.  Clues outside the grid give the sum of the digits along the indicated diagonal. Digits along the diagonal may repeat if allowed by other rules. In the grid, the digits along the path of an arrow sum to the digit in that arrow\u2019s circled cell. Digits along the arrow path may repeat if allowed by other rules. Digits along a grey lines form a palindrome i.e. the sequence of digits reads the same forwards and backwards e.g. 1234321.\n\n\u25b6  SIMON VS PHISTOMEFEL \u25c0\nIf you'd like to try the Phistomefel's Yin-Yang Fillomino, you can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/49gg9R9jT6\n\nRules and example puzzle can be found here:\nhttps://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00053V\n\nA (long) video of Simon doing battle with this puzzle is out now on Patreon.\n\n\nPlease follow us on Twitter: @crypticcracking\n\n**************************************************************\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW KILLER SUDOKU APP IS OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS\u25c0\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/killer-sudoku-ctc/id1544165118\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1471910/Killer_Sudoku/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.KillerSudoku&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n\u25b6  SIMON REACTION BOARD (!) \u25c0\nWith thanks to Andrea for creating this :)\nhttps://simonreacts.avris.it/\n\n\u25b6 OUR MIRACLE SUDOKU APP IS OUT \u25c0\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377260/Miracle_Sudoku/\nApp Store:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527363795\nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.MiracleSudokuCTC\n\n\u25b6 CTC FAN DISCORD SERVER\u25c0\nhttps://discord.gg/BbN89j5\n\nNEW:  Guide To Our Discord Server:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCDiscordGuide\n\n\u25b6 OUR BACK CATALOGUE \u2013 ALL CATEGORISED WITH LINKS!\u25c0\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCCatalogue\n\n\u25b6 OUR NEW THERMO SUDOKU APP IS OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thermo-sudoku/id1513994223  \nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ThermoSudoku\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1316390/Thermo_Sudoku/  \n\n\u25b6 *NEW* CRACKING THE CRYPTIC MERCHANDISE\u25c0 \nhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/cracking-the-cryptic\n\n\u25b6 OUR CHESS SUDOKU APP IS NOW OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-sudoku/id1500654482?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250560/Chess_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ChessSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR CLASSIC SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/classic-sudoku/id1488838275?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188330/Classic_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ClassicSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR SANDWICH SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandwich-sudoku/id1476116705?ls=1 \nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117310/Sandwich_Sudoku/  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.SandwichSudoku\n\n\u25b6SEND US PUZZLES TO SOLVE/CONTACT US\u25c0\ncrackingthecryptic@gmail.com\n\n\u25b6FOLLOW US\u25c0\nTwitter: #crypticcracking \n@crypticcracking\nInstagram (for how to solve daily clues from The Times): https://www.instagram.com/crackingthecryptic/?hl=en\n\n\u25b6SOFTWARE\u25c0\nPlay the puzzle in the video by clicking the link under the video (above).

        "description": "*** Join Simon at 10pm UK time tonight - 90 minutes after this video goes live - for his attempt at The Music Box Challenge in The Witness.  Link here:\nhttps://youtu.be/HClxzvx1DQs\n\n*****\n\nWe suspect you won't have seen a sudoku like today's ever before.  Not even The Miracle Sudoku was quite so sparse.  That's right Empty Grid by Jodawo literally has nothing in the grid at all.  What is going on?!?! You can play the puzzle at the following link: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/MLt47676Pr\n\nRules: \nIn this puzzle \u20182-digit numbers\u2019 read from left to right or downwards. Box 1 (NW) will contain all the 2-digit square numbers (16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81), which may overlap but must be entirely contained within the box. Box 9 (SE) is a clone of box 1, rotated through 180\u00b0. In each of boxes 3 (NE), 5 (centre) and 7 (SW), each digit will contribute to at least one 2-digit prime number contained within that box. Box 4 (W) is a magic square, with each row, column, and 3-digit diagonal summing to the same total. In each of box 6 (E) and 8 (S), the two 3-digit diagonals sum to the same number (NB box 6's number may be different from box 8's number).\n\n*** Botaku Bonus Puzzle *** \nAs mentioned in the video, we have a bonus puzzle today from the brilliant Botaku.  It's called Euclidean Sudoku!  You can play it at the link below and watch a video of Simon solving it on our Patreon page.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\nPlay the puzzle here:\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/tMmgPBBP93\nSudokuPad link: https://tinyurl.com/4t74y7rs\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. Given two cells which both contain the digit N, the Euclidean distance between (the centres of) those cells must be at least \u221aN times the sidelength of a single cell. In other words, if moving from one such cell to the other takes X horizontal steps and Y  vertical steps, then \u221a(X^2 + Y^2) \u2265 \u221aN. \n\n\u25b6 SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  \u25c0\nYou can now input your own classic sudoku puzzles into our software using our new App!

All is explained in the video but this is a sudoku you won't want to miss.  You can play it here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/LNqP9d8tdj\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. The grey circle is odd and the grey square is even. Digits along the blue line must be between the values at each end of that line. Digits along an arrow sum to the value in the associated circle. (The two-digit pill should be read as a two-digit number from left to right for these purposes.) Digits in a cage do not repeat; if a value is given for the cage, the digits sum to that value. Digits along a thermometer must increase from the bulb end. The orange cell is greater than the four digits orthogonally adjacent to it. Two cells separated by a black dot must have a 1:2 ratio. Digits along the marked brown diagonal may not repeat.\n\n**************************************************************\n\nWe have just released a brand new puzzle hunt by Reverend on Patreon!!!!

Note that the edge of the grid does not count toward this total.\nRemark: There is no negative constraint regarding the circle, i.e. there can be uncircled cells containing a digit that equals the number of edges seen in the respective row and column.\n\nPatrons of the channel on Patreon can watch a video where Mark solves the example puzzle from the logic masters link above right now.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n*** Our Patreon - The Best Sudoku Club In The World *** \nYou can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month and access a lot of extra content.  Today Mark has added his solve of the example from Phistomefel's new puzzle!  This will give you an idea of what Simon will face tomorrow.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n\u25b6 SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  \u25c0\nYou can now input your own classic sudoku puzzles into our software using our new App!

        "description": "Today's puzzle was recommended to us by none other than Phistomefel.  One of the other comments on Logic Masters Germany about this sudoku is from Jeet Sampat who noted \"Solving this puzzle correctly is the best thing I have done in my life by a long shot.\"...  In other words, it's rather special.  It's called Ten Knights and it's by FryTheGuy... you can play the puzzle at at the following link: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/D4mmRBrG4G\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply.  Cells that are a chess knight's move apart must not contain the same digit. In cages, digits must sum to the small clue in the top left corner of the cage. Digits cannot repeat within a cage.\n\nThe classic sudoku pack from shye, jovi_al, Sam Cappleman-Lynes and Philip Newman which teaches you advanced sudoku techniques can be downloaded free from our Patreon page here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\nPS If we manage to reach 400,000 subscribers then we'll be releasing a video where Mark and Simon answer community questions!

        "title": "The Best Sudoku Puzzle Ever?  We Attempt THAT Puzzle!",
        "description": "Here it is!  Simon's attempt to solve Two Truths And A Lie by zetamath.  The puzzle with a ruleset as lengthy as the puzzle is brilliant :) \n\nNote this puzzle originally appeared as a bonus video on our Patreon page (which is why the video introduction is as it is!).  You can support the channel on Patreon here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\nThe rules to the puzzle are explained in detail below and you can play the puzzle here:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/NFhHj2bQ2g\n\nRules:\nNormal sudoku rules apply. Each of the following standard clue types occurs exactly three times in the grid: white dots, black dots, arrow, sandwich, Xs, Vs, thermos, quadruples, odds (grey circles), evens (grey squares), renban (purple) and German whispers (green). For each of those clue types, exactly two of the appearances of that clue are correct and the other is incorrect.  [A clue is incorrect if it is not fully correct.  Eg an incorrect quadruple might see one of the digits but not all of them.]\n\nThe \"standard\" clue types mentioned above are as follows:\nWhite dots:  Cells separated by a white dot must contain consecutive digits.\nBlack dots: Cells separated by a black dot must be in the ratio of 1:2 (so one digit must be double the other).\nArrow:  Digits on an arrow must sum to the digit in that arrow's circle.\nSandwich:  Clues outside the grid give the sum of the digits sandwiched between the 1 and 9 in that row/column.\nXs:  Cells separated by an X must contain digits summing to 10.\nVs:  Cells separated by a V must contain digits summing to 5.\nThermos: Along a thermometer, digits must increase from the bulb end.\nQuadruples: Digits in the small circles in the grid must appear at least once in every cell touched by the circle.\nOdds:  Cells containing a grey circle must contain an odd digit.\nEvens: Cells containing a grey square must contain an even digit.\nRenban: Each purple line must contain a set of non-repeating consecutive digits (which can be in any order).\nGerman Whispers: Adjacent digits on a green line must differ by at least 5.",

You can give it a try the puzzle at the link below: \n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/6nhndtjdHB\n\nRules: \nNormal sudoku rules apply. The square bulb and line form a 'thermometer' which must be populated by double-digit numbers.  Each number starts with the tens-digit followed by the units digit (seen from the bulb end) ie tens and units digits alternate along the line.  The numbers must increase moving away from the bulb.\n\n\u25b6 PATREON MADNESS \u25c0\nAs a Patreon bonus, Simon has recorded his solve of the beautiful puzzle Mark attempted recently by Sumanta Mukherjee.

        "title": "The Light Bulb Sudoku",
        "description": "Today's puzzle is a riddle and then a sudoku (and both are brilliant!).  It's called Light Bulb Moment by ZergreS and this is such an innovative idea, we're really blown away. You can play it at the following link:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/JBNhmrn8dq\n\nRules: \nRiddle: A long hallway has 43 light bulbs on the ceiling. Each light bulb has a pull cord that turns it on and off. All the lightbulbs start turned off. 43 people go down this hallway. The first person pulls every cord: 1,2,3,4... (now all bulbs are on) The second person pulls every other cord: 2,4,6,8... The third person pulls every third cord: 3,6,9,12... And so on with the rest. Finally the 43rd person pulls cord 43. Which bulbs are on after all the people have passed through? Feel free to use the Sudoku Grid to work out the answer.  \nSudoku: Mark the final lit up bulbs in the Sudoku grid. (The hallway starts with Bulb 1 in R1C3) Lit hallway cells are brighter (higher) than their hallway neighbors. Hallway cells get darker (lower) as you get further away from a lit cell. Between every two lit cells in the hallway there will be a darkest (lowest) cell. It can be anywhere between the two lit cells. Arrows show the way through the hall. Digits along an arrow sum to the circled digit.\n\n*** Our Book ***\nThe PDF is available as of today and the physical copy shouldn't be far behind.

        "description": "\u25b6 SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  \u25c0\n\nIt's OUT on Windows TODAY via Steam here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1706870/Svens_SudokuPad/\n\nCheck it out (and the bonus puzzle exclusively for SudokuPad we tweeted today on @crypticcracking).\n\n*** Today's Sudoku ***\n\nToday's sudoku comes from China and it's a slighly easier form of the livestream puzzle Simon attempted earlier in the week.  There is a ton of beautiful logic in this one:  Play the puzzle at the following link:\n\nhttps://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/6JBh99JDJJ\n\nRules: \nThe grid must be divided into regions, each containing 9 cells.  Each row, column and region must contain the digits 1 to 9 once each. A number outside the grid gives the sum of the first M cells of the row/column from that direction.  M is the number of region borders in that row/column. The 4 cells surrounding a circle must belong to the same region. The 4 cells surrounding a black square belong to exactly three different regions. All unmarked 2x2 areas belong to two or four regions.\n\n*** More Patreon Content ***\nSimon released a video on Patreon on Tuesday where he attempts the first 8 puzzles from the new Genuinely Approachable Pencil Puzzle series on Discord.  There are also the solution videos to our November monthly reward, the Japanese Sum Sudoku hunt from Panthera and TheAsylm. You can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month here:  \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic\n\n*** Our Book ***\nThe PDF is available as of today and the physical copy shouldn't be far behind.  If you don't own the book then it can still be ordered here:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterchayward/cracking-the-cryptics-greatest-hits/\n\n**************************************************************\n\n\u25b6 OUR ARROW SUDOKU APP IS OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS!\nHere are the links:\nSteam:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1613680/Arrow_Sudoku/\nApp Store:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/arrow-sudoku/id1568407537\nGoogle Play:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ArrowSudoku\n\n\u25b6 OUR KILLER SUDOKU APP IS OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS\u25c0\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/killer-sudoku-ctc/id1544165118\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1471910/Killer_Sudoku/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.KillerSudoku&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n\u25b6  SIMON REACTION BOARD (!) \u25c0\nWith thanks to Andrea for creating this :)\nhttps://simonreacts.avris.it/\n\n\u25b6 CTC FAN DISCORD SERVER\u25c0\nhttps://discord.gg/BbN89j5\n\nNEW:  Guide To Our Discord Server:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCDiscordGuide\n\n\u25b6 OUR BACK CATALOGUE \u2013 ALL CATEGORISED WITH LINKS!\u25c0\nhttps://tinyurl.com/CTCCatalogue\n\n\u25b6 *NEW* CRACKING THE CRYPTIC MERCHANDISE\u25c0 \nhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/cracking-the-cryptic\n\n\u25b6 OUR CHESS SUDOKU APP IS NOW OUT!\u25c0\nAppStore:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-sudoku/id1500654482?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250560/Chess_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ChessSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR CLASSIC SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/classic-sudoku/id1488838275?ls=1\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188330/Classic_Sudoku/\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.ClassicSudoku&hl=en_US\n\n\u25b6TRY OUR SANDWICH SUDOKU APP\u25c0\nAppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandwich-sudoku/id1476116705?ls=1 \nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1117310/Sandwich_Sudoku/  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioGoya.SandwichSudoku\n\n\u25b6SEND US PUZZLES TO SOLVE/CONTACT US\u25c0\ncrackingthecryptic@gmail.com\n\n\u25b6FOLLOW US\u25c0\nTwitter: #crypticcracking \n@crypticcracking\nInstagram (for how to solve daily clues from The Times): https://www.instagram.com/crackingthecryptic/?hl=en\n\n\u25b6SOFTWARE\u25c0\nPlay the puzzle in the video by clicking the link under the video (above).
